{"question": "can a real image be obtained on a screen", "passage": "Real image -- In optics, a real image is an image which is located in the plane of convergence for the light rays that originate from a given object.

In ray diagrams (such as the images on the right), real rays of light are always represented by full, solid lines; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines.

{"question": "delphi group decision making is used to develop consensus among a group of experts", "passage": "Delphi method -- The Delphi method (/\u02c8d\u025blfa\u026a/ DEL-fy) is a structured communication technique or method, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts.

After each round, a facilitator or change agent provides an anonymised summary of the experts' forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the ``correct'' answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a predefined stop criterion (e.g. number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results) and the mean or median scores of the final rounds determine the results.", "idx": 7396, "label": true}
