"TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE. &lt;Teck Corp> said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when negotiations would be completed. Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been ""ongoing for a long time."" He declined to speculate on the outcome. Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don Townson told Reuters. ""I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved,"" Cominco's Townson said. ""We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly,"" he added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end. Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley copper operations. Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct. For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct copper, Townson said. Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold, he said. A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM (Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired its Cominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP>."	copper

NORANDA BEGINS SALVAGE OPERATIONS AT MURDOCHVILLE. &lt;Noranda Inc> said it began salvage operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage. Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as 24 hours before they were brought to safety. Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt. Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine. Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone will not be completed before the end of April. Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting an investigation into the fire. Production at the mine has been suspended until the investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680 people. The smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter	copper

CHINA, CHILE TO BUILD COPPER TUBE PLANT IN CHINA. China's state-owned Beijing Non-Ferrous Metals Industrial Corp and &lt;Wrought Copper Ltd> of Chile signed a contract to jointly build a copper tube plant on the outskirts of Peking, the China Daily said. The Beijing-Santiago Copper Tube Co involves an investment of 9.93 mln dlrs and will, on completion, have a production capacity of 5,000 tonnes of copper tubes a year, it said. It said Chile will supply copper at preferential rates to the venture, whose equipment comes from &lt;Wednesbury Tube Co> of U.K. The agreement calls for joint Sino-Chilean management of the venture for 15 years, the paper said. It said the venture is the first economic cooperation project between China and Chile, but gave no more details. China is a major copper importer. Customs figures show it imported 171,118 tonnes of copper and alloy in calendar 1986, down from 355,652 tonnes in 1985.	copper

"PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES. Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices for the metal. In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last month. ""Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates of our trucks,"" he said, referring to tightness of supply and strong demand. ""The fundamentals are good.""  Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said; ""All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."" He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on record behind 1984, he said. Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.  During the interview, executive vice president Douglas Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before the copper price rose ""because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly."" Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for Phelps Dodge, the company said. ""Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction and other areas,"" Yearley said.  New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said. Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The company's total production costs, including depreciation but before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said."	copper
PHELPS DODGE SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY MORE FROM COPPER. Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck in the near future, chairman G. Robert Durham said. Durham told Reuters the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must have a different economic cycle to copper, he said. Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon black used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between copper and non-copper operations. The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.	copper
"ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT. Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said. But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. ""We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a ZCCM official said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans. ""We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,"" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export profits. ""Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,"" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel."	copper

"CIPEC STUDYING COPPER MARKET BACKWARDATION. The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the current backwardation in world copper market prices but does not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources here said. The organisation's executive and marketing committees reviewed the current market situation during a series of meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions. The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks and is the longest on record. ""It's unusual,"" one official said, but added CIPEC did not have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation. The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of CIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres, which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil. Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in late September. The last three ministerial meetings have been held in Paris to keep down costs."	copper
OUTOKUMPU IN COPPER DEAL WITH IBERICA DEL COBRE.

City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement. It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a total of 2.1 mln ounces. City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres. In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator. The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd> after it was floated in Canada in 1926.

He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden. Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden's presence in Saudi Arabia. ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future,"" he said. The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said. Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times. ""This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining technology and knowhow,"" said the group's chief executive, Kjell Nilsson."	gold

"STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a ""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress,"" he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he said."	money-fx
TOP OFFICIALS ARRIVE AT TREASURY FOR G-5 TALKS. Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

"FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY. Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures."" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials ""reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."""	money-fx
"G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago."	money-fx

"U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY. Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have ""now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."" Baker said, ""These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels."" As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances ""simply are not sustainable,"" Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting ""strong domestic pressure"" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill. ""While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,"" he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall. ""We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary,"" he said."	money-fx

"TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts."" He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today."" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,"" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving beyond rhetoric to action."" He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination."" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"" he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options."" He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. ""If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,"" he said."	money-fx
U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 400 MLN STG. The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today.

BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS.

The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the bills to a record 4,800 billion yen. The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct. The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800 billion yen. They said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to continuous large central bank dollar purchases.	money-fx

"VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS. Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker here said. ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control,"" the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against foreigners."" The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small currency it was miraculous."" He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market."	money-fx
"POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK. For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,"" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply."" One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit."	money-fx
"TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE. Taiwan's central bank announced that as from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at the end of May. The central bank's statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August. Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars.

The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they said. It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said. Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said. However, as one dealer noted: ""The market is still unsettled."" Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight. Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early 9-1/2, 7-1/2. One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close. The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40."	money-fx
"LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY. The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.  ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced ""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord. ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was ""very important."" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."" ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,"" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions. ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. ""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to push further."""	money-fx
"LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL. The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was ""content"" with sterling's current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted ""to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for."" He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added. Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the market pressures there are from time to time."" ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said. ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawson said. ""I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."""	money-fx
"NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES. Currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said. Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency, analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower, analysts said.  ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff. ""The international community will not like this appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"" Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7 summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes,"" Horner said. Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950."	money-fx

Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange rate influences.

Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the ""parallel market"" in which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves. The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar here. Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house, said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total amount of almost one mln dlrs.

"IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST. If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street, Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way, Japan investment managers say. The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar securities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department. An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S. Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning. ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said. Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914. ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult, considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group. Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for. The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said. ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However, this was already evident three months ago, he said."	money-fx

Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities -- to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability. ""Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary policy will continue because it is very much in the national interest that it do so,"" he said.

"LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS. U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London economists said. ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,"" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said."	money-fx

"G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT. International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets, economists and currency traders said.

"TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS. The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"" Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on."" French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."" Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord."" In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct."	money-fx

WEST GERMANY STILL COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD. West German government sources said Bonn remained committed to the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies, which was struck by leading western democracies in Paris last February. Over the weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker criticised recent rises in West German short-term interest rates and said such developments were not in the spirit of the Louvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-examined. The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide.	money-fx
FED SEEN ADDING RESERVES VIA SYSTEM REPOS. The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the government securities market to supply reserves to the banking system via system repurchase agreements, economists said. Most economists said the Fed would execute three-day system repurchases to meet a substantial need to add reserves in the current maintenance period, although some said a more aggressive add via overnight system repos was possible. Federal funds opened at 7-5/8 pct and remained at that level late this morning, compared with an average effective rate of 7.55 pct Friday.	money-fx

""I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the dollar is still within the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the accord has been terminated,"" Christians said. He was responding to questions about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was still operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates."	money-fx

BANKS EXTEND TRADING HALT IN LEBANESE POUND. Lebanon's Bankers Association said it extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's collapse. The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the dollar and other currencies on Monday. The pound closed on Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00. Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound. The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week. The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this year.	money-fx

PAKISTAN CONFIRMS KENYA TEA IMPORT INVESTIGATION. Pakistan's Corporate Law Authority, CLA, has begun an enquiry into imports of tea from Kenya and the trade imbalance between the two countries, CLA chairman Irtiza Husain confirmed. He told Reuters by telephone that importers Liptons and Brooke Bond had been asked to supply data to the authority and a hearing would be held. The CLA would then report back to the Commerce Ministry, which had requested the enquiry. Husain said no date had yet been set for the hearing and declined to give further details of the matter. Industry sources told Reuters reports that the companies' tea import licences had been suspended were incorrect.	tea
SRI LANKAN TEA WORKERS LAUNCH ONE-DAY PROTEST. Thousands of tea workers of Indian origin went on strike today to press demands for citizenship and voting rights in Sri Lanka, a union statement said. The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) said its 400,000 members launched a prayer campaign at temples and other places in a non-violent protest to get the authorities to expedite citizenship procedures. A CWC spokesman said a three-day campaign was suspended after a Cabinet committee promised to speed up procedures under a new set of regulations. Trade sources said the strike did not affect production or today's Colombo auction.	tea
STATE TO CONTROL 70 PCT OF PAKISTAN TEA IMPORTS. Pakistan announced a new tea import policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP). Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from any one country. The new policy was announced some three months after the government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry into tea purchase policy. Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya, which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange. Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders said. Haq, who is also Planning Minister, was outlining a new three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on July 1.	tea

Its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was ""rather high"" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of 1986. It said China's industrial production this year has been normal but product quality and efficiency need further improvement.

SWEDISH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RISES SHARPLY. Swedish industrial production rose 2.6 pct in February, after a 1.8 pct fall in January, showing a 4.4 pct rise over February 1986 and reaching its highest level ever, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The rise reflected recovery in almost all sectors after an exceptionally cold spell in January, the Bureau said, adding that the highest rises were seen in the forest, chemical and metal industries.	ipi
FRENCH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RISES IN FEBRUARY. French industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted three pct in February after an unrevised 1.98 pct fall in January, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.

"BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. The Bank of France said in its latest monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in industrial production registered in March to gather steam over the next few months. Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise, partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to a firming of domestic demand. ""New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital goods where production will remain at its present level,"" the report added. The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for the first time since June 1982. While the automobile industry remained unchanged from previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all sectors continued to slow."	ipi
SOVIET INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT UP IN FIRST QUARTER. Soviet industrial output in the first quarter of this year grew by 2.5 pct compared with the first three months of 1986, Tass news agency reported.

"SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH. Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987. In the first nine months of this year, industrial output rose by 3.6 pct. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in 1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year. The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the harvest this year. Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods, increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the 7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale measures are planned to save resources,"" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the same as announced last year. Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and social insurance schemes He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171 billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan."	ipi
SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987. The Soviet Union's industrial output is growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show. Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against 194 roubles a year ago.	ipi
"ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT. Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>. ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,"" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute."	trade

Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues. ""There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,"" he said.

"JAPANESE OFFICIAL TAKES DATA TO MICROCHIP TALKS.

But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. ""I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation,"" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces. ""The U.S. Has excessive expectations.

Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.

"JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS. Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade."" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""

"DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT. Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy. The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year. ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander said in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets. ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street."" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts."	trade
SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986. The Soviet trade deficit with the West almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed. Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8 pct. Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued to grow in 1986. Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the West.	trade

EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS. The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains. Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market.	trade

"CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY. Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year. The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory."""	trade

JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE. Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said. Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week. However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday. Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods. Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.	trade
"TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS. Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,"" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating."	trade
"BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS. A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets ""and it was clearly understood."" Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about access to their own markets. At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed. ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood."" Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain. ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds."" ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them."" He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship. ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets."" On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case. He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said. Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners. Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened."	trade
SINGAPORE EXTERNAL TRADE GAINS 8.8 PCT IN QUARTER.

However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6 pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.	trade
TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN. Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, they point out.	trade

"EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY. The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said. They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides. The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."" Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves. In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods. Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March."	trade

"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS. Basic reform of Japan's protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said. The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said. ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added. ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. ""All that money could be spent on something else."" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said. ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said. Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew."	trade

President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities."" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action."" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States."	trade
"YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned. Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said ""slim to none."" Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks."" Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers. He said he did not think Japan would retaliate. ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,"" Yeutter said. He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade."" Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit."""	trade
"U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS. The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday. The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports. Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward. The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously. ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure."" The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs. The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979. Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis. The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration. Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures. ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come.""

"JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING. The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said. But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern."" He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal"" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets. ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice."" The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws."" But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue. ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade."" Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress."" He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense."" But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use. Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

"YEUTTER ALMOST SURE JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today. ""I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products,"" Yeutter told Cable News Network. ""Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation,"" Yeutter said. Earlier today, Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade. Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back. ""If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like American agricultural products,"" he said. ""But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none,"" he added."	trade
JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE NOW AGAINST U.S. TARIFFS. Japan does not plan to take immediate retaliatory action against implementation of U.S. Tariffs on some Japanese electronic goods, the minister of international trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, said in a statement. Japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with Article 23-1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Washington yesterday. Tamura said there was deep regret over the U.S. Measures, which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese imports of some small computers, colour television sets and power tools.	trade
"SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.. South Korea will cut import taxes on 50 items, including construction equipment, photographic film, cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United States, the finance ministry said. The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points, take effect on July 1. This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said. The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added. Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had had sought free access to the South Korean market. ""This is in line with the government's policy to limit our trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade friction between the two countries,"" the official said. South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials said the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs. The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check inflation. The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three pct this year."	trade
"U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE. The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government study said. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms. ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said. ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,"" the study said. ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"" the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit."	trade

"JAPAN CONCERNED AT EC TRADE THREATS - MINISTER. Japan is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.

Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports. Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31. ""I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion.""

U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS. The White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted, U.S. officials said. They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly. But there was no hint what the announcement might be. Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact. But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact.	trade
"SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected. But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips. Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.  ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington. ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,"" he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market. ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident."" He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data. The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value. Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand. Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem. He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction."	trade
"REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION. President Reagan called for continued nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United States in the face of congressional opposition because of the Bucharest government's record on human rights. A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Romania had been ""exceptionally difficult"" and came after ""all options were seriously considered."" But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there. The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary and China. The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China."	trade
"INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY. With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today. The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago. ""While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said."	trade
"SHULTZ PREDICTS RAPID NARROWING OF U.S. TRADE GAP. Secretary of State George Shultz said the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic.

""In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many observers now predict."" ""The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is becoming less effective,"" Shultz said. ""It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit, which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."" ""The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience,"" he added. ""While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies, you must act too,"" Shultz said. ""I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider,"" he told the group, which included representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the European Community."	trade
TOSHIBA, SHARP RESTRAIN LAP-TOP PC EXPORTS TO EC. Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp &lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels, despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen told Reuters. They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April. Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said. Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being. Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year's level of 12,000 to 16,000 units a year. Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.	trade

"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES. The European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee. EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters. Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments. The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue. Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September. When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as ""standstill and rollback."" Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security. Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules. The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges. The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices. The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation. Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community, brought the dispute to the GATT last year."	trade
"U.S. SAID UNFAIRLY PROTECTING DEFENSE INDUSTRY. Britain's Defence Minister George Younger said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures. Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S. Legislators were failing to realise ""the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment. A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure. The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and ""selectiveness"" towards foreign contractors had denied British competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them from technological research for SDI. Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. ""All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities,"" he added. If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures, Younger said."	trade
"U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT. U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups. The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries. But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement."" The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries. The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said. It would also increase the gross national products of both countries. Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes."	trade

Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S. Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed. He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress, ""but simply because of the adjustments the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt."" Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth."	trade
JAPAN'S JUNE INTERIM TRADE SURPLUS NARROWS. Japan's custom-cleared trade surplus narrowed to 1.61 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of June from 1.97 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said. The June interim surplus compares with a 1.76 billion dlr surplus in the same May period. FOB exports in the first 10 days of June rose 17.6 pct from a year earlier to 6.05 billion dlrs while CIF imports rose 39.6 pct to 4.44 billion. The average yen/dollar rate used for the figures was 141.04 yen against 169.03 a year earlier.	trade
JAPAN MUST TRY HARDER TO CUT SURPLUS - MINISTER. Japan must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure, Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo. He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or about 4.5 pct of GNP. The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.	trade
"REAGAN SAYS TRADE BILL FACES VETO IN PRESENT FORM. President Reagan said he would veto a House-passed trade bill requiring mandatory retaliation for ""unfair trade"" if it reached its desk in its present form. In a statement at a White House meeting with Senate Republicans on the legislation, he said: ""I would have no choice but to veto that bill in its present form."" He said the measure ""would move us exactly in the wrong direction"" towards high tariffs, trade barriers, trade distorting subsidies, slow growth and crimped world markets, and would destroy jobs."	trade
AFRICAN STATES AGREE TO REGIONAL TARIFF CUTS. Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996. A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year. In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000. The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue. The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.	trade

"LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS. A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt. Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills."" He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."" Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs. Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation."" Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress."" President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation. Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."""	trade
"U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES. The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face."" He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988."	trade
"BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88. Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the government relaxed restrictions on some imports including luxury cars. The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs, compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and 1.113 billion dlrs of imports. Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery and raw materials, to increase industrial production. The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told reporters. Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the government were not included in the policy, they added. They said the country's total import bill (both commercial and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87. The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the economy. Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export earnings"" in the coming year. Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln in 1986/87, according official figures. But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target."	trade
EC, U.S. REMAIN DIVIDED OVER PASTA DISPUTE. Top-level talks last week between the European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next month, diplomatic sources said. The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market. The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S. U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports. The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled. But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.	trade

Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade friction unless it was settled soon. Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an increasing share of the U.S. pasta market.

"ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.. Israel's exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication. Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total. ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,"" Yaacobi said. While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports. In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year. Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth. Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa. Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential. Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said. Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period."	trade
"LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies. In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it. ""Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,"" he said. ""There's no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow, the longer it is to wean it."" In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries. Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies ""just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy"" and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP. ""I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those, particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it,"" he said."	trade

Ecuador posted a trade deficit of 71.3 mln dlrs in the first eight months of 1987, compared with a surplus of 468.6 mln dlrs in the same period of 1986, central bank figures show. Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year after an earthquake in March shattered the country's pipeline. The central bank said the value of exports from January to August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204 billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to 57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end- September 1986.	trade
BRAZIL'S SEPT TRADE SURPLUS HIGHEST OF THE YEAR. Brazil's September trade surplus was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs, compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference. September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August. Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period. Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said. The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach 10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and 15.4 billion dlrs of imports. He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.	trade
U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN. The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said. President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.	trade
"CANADA SEEKS FIVE YEAR FARM REFORM PLAN. Canada will propose at the new round of international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister Pat Carney said. ""Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a vicious circle which continues to cause problems of overproduction and low commodity prices,"" Carney told the House of Commons. Carney was outlining the government's new position on the farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). While few details were released, Carney said the government would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial barriers. ""Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,"" a government background paper said. ""Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs, credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products,"" the papers said."	trade
"US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system. He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT."" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."" He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living."" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."""	trade
EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS. The European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year, an EC commission spokesman said. He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said. Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers. It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year. Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the countries involved in the Airbus project.	trade

"COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES. Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. ""The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening."	cocoa
COCOA TERMINAL DEPOSITS TO BE CUT 25 PCT - ICCH. The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10, taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said. The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said. The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates. The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the spokesman said. The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market, he said.	cocoa
"BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES. Brazilian cocoa exporters are not likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA, members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to boost world prices, trade sources said. They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans. ""The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will,"" a trade source said. The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde. The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria.

"DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER. Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told Reuters. ""The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it,"" one company spokesman said. Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes. Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market. ""Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so,"" one manufacturer said. ""We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back,"" he added. ""The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,"" one processor said. ""As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods,"" he added. Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come."	cocoa
BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE. Brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said. The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted. The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added. If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission, they said.	cocoa
COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION. Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.	cocoa

"ICCO BUFFER TO BUY 3,000 TONNES COCOA JUNE 3. The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement. It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement. These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival/delivery. The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins. The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from ""cif landed"" and 38.00 pounds sterling from ""cif shipping weights"" to ""in store"") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said. No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added."	cocoa

JAPAN TO RATIFY 1986 INTERNATIONAL COCOA AGREEMENT. Japan will ratify the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA), with effect from July 1, and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO), Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said. They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy. The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987. Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue, the officials said.	cocoa
"ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS. Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior. ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future."" Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,"" the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces. PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain. The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics"" and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest cocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques. One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates."	cocoa

"TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES. Steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts. But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits. ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already."" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>. ""There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way,"" he said. ""We think the stock will do moderately better than the market,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it,"" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lot depends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales come from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for,"" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. ""I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"" he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. ""But there are more positives than negatives,"" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year."	iron-steel

EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT. A new steel quota system that would strictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own solution quickly, officials said. EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln tonnes by 1990. The first would limit the current quota system, which has protected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products into free market competition. The second proposal would link continuation of a quota system with progress toward plant closures, although less than a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily. The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks. The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final decision.	iron-steel

A spokesman for &lt;National Steel Corp>, a joint venture of National Intergroup Inc &lt;NII> and Nippon Kokan K.K., said the company is not in the product lines affected. Reached later, an Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD> spokesman said the company was studying the pricing move. USX said the increase will be on all plate products, including carbon, high-strength low-alloy, strip mill and alloy plates. It also said it planned 20-dlr-a-ton increases on some special plate widths and thicknesses. Analysts have said firm prices for steel should contribute to better results at the nation's major steelmakers.	iron-steel

The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot transactions and will be achieved through reductions in competitive discounts. The company said transaction prices for contract accounts, which have a duration of six months or more, will also be increased to commensurate levels. Percentage increases were not immediately available. Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles, appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350 and 800 dlrs a ton. The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases, prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said. Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price contracts.	iron-steel

Spain's foreign reserves rose by 905 mln dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with 14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures show. Under a new accounting system introduced this month, Spain's foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by financial institutions. Under the previous system, Spain's foreign reserves would have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions' foreign currency position. In January this year, the Central Bank's foreign reserves rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions' foreign currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.	reserves

U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY. Britain's gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said. The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs. The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April. Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month. Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs. The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments. It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.	reserves

Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835 billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986. The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May, with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion. ""Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance between the purchase and sale of foreign securities,"" the statement added.

FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES RISE IN MAY. French official reserves rose 258 mln francs in May to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at the end of April, the Finance Ministry said. The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month of France's outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with France's Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May. Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to 124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France's debt owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the ministry said. Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97 billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France's reserve position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of Special Drawing Rights.

"TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT RECORD HIGH. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank officials said Tuesday. Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on October 5. He declined to elaborate. A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at the end of the year. ""The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank market,"" Chang said.

NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON. Nickel prices are unlikely to rise significantly from current levels unless further steps are taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in its quarterly nickel market report. The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January, due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness. Output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere. Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at 556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in 1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000). It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987 sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.	nickel
AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT. Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said. The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said. The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today. Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said. The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws. The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off. Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said. They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.	ship

INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE. The two sides in the Rotterdam port general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings, employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said. Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies. Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year. The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds. The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future. Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said.

AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL. Union and New South Wales government officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers compensation, averting increased industrial action in the state, union sources said. But some unions, including those of building and mining workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days. State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers. Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers' compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of the compromise package are not yet known. The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales unless the government modified its pending legislation on the issue. State officials said the only sectors affected in the past three days were some government building projects, railway freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.	ship
"IRAN SAYS IT WILL COMBAT GULF INTERVENTION. Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati warned that Iran would combat any superpower intervention in the Gulf. ""Iran, which is the most powerful (country) in the Gulf... Will not allow the superpowers or any other foreign forces to interfere in the region,"" he said. Velayati, visiting the United Arab Emirates on the first leg of a Gulf tour, told reporters Iran had the ""capabilities and means"" to prevent any interference. President Reagan has pledged to keep the Gulf sealanes open and to protect Kuwaiti tankers from possible Iranian attack."	ship
"MOSCOW SAYS WILL RETALIATE AGAINST GULF ATTACKS. Any Iranian attack on Soviet ships in the Gulf will bring a forceful and violent response, a Soviet foreign ministry official said in an interview published here. Alexander Ivanov, head of the Gulf desk at the Soviet Foreign Ministry, told Al-Rai al-Aam newspaper Moscow ""will answer back with force and violence if Iran attempts to attack any Soviet ship or tanker in the Gulf."" A Soviet tanker hit a mine in the Gulf last month. Ivanov also accused the United States of stepping up the regional crisis and of failing to exert genuine efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war."	ship
"KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES. Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy boats. ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen. The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing. It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year. The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and oil ministers. Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing vessels by Iran was not the first. Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said. ""However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were undertaking espionage activities,"" it said. Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the statement said."	ship
"COLOMBO TO DEFEND WATERS, INDIA READIES FLOTILLA. Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces to defend the island's territorial waters as India prepared to send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula. The sudden crisis between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour deepened as Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa told parliament: ""We have our territorial limits and nobody can be allowed to trespass there ... ""President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"" Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house. In New Delhi an Indian spokesman said the plan to send a flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with Red Cross supplies to Jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite Colombo's objections. The confrontation was the latest result of the long and bitter conflict between Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the Hindu Tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and cultural links with India's 50 mln Tamils."	ship
"NEED FOR BIGGER ALLIED FORCE IN GULF PLAYED DOWN. Secretary of State George Shultz said today that a boost in allied forces in the Mideast Gulf was not vital to protect shipping against attack but that possible allied contributions should be examined. Asked if he saw the need for a greater military presence by the allies in the gulf, Shultz told reporters, ""Not necessarily, particularly, so."" But he said an adequate force was needed to deter attack and noted that the British and the French, as well as the United States, maintained naval contingents there. ""We have to look at things that others might do,"" he said."	ship
"U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS. U.S. military forces in the Mideast Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to ""non-belligerent"" states in the area, the Pentagon said today. ""No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters,"" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf. Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. ""As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region,"" Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere. He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war. Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack. Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration."	ship
LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES. House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt. The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf. The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution. Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.	ship
U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions. The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report.	ship
"U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL. The House today approved a bill requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions. The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill. He said he will put a so-called ""hold"" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war. Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war. ""It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst,"" said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth."	ship
JAPAN FOREIGN SHIPBUILDING ORDERS FALL IN MAY. New foreign shipbuilding orders received by Japanese yards in May fell to five vessels totalling 188,900 gross tons (gt) from eight ships of 314,000 gt in April, against four ships of 104,500 gt a year earlier, the Japan Ship Exporters Association said. The backlog of orders at end-May was 122 ships of 3.70 mln gt against 125 ships of 3.73 mln at end-April and 233 ships of 5.99 mln a year ago, an association official said. The world shipping recession and the yen's appreciation against the dollar depressed May orders, he said.	ship
RIO DE JANEIRO DOCKERS STRIKE OVER WAGES. Rio de Janeiro's 3,500 dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to demand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.

"TAIWAN'S EVERGREEN LINE TO GO PUBLIC. Liner shipping specialist &lt;Evergreen Marine Corp>, Taiwan's largest private company, has applied to the Security and Exchange Commission to go public next month, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. She said Evergreen had doubled its capital to eight billion Taiwan dlrs since last August. ""The capital increase will boost our operations,"" she said. She said Evergreen will use the funds raised from the stock market to buy new ships and step up its global services. The spokeswoman said the company posted an after-tax profit of more than one billion dlrs last year on total revenues of 20.46 billion, compared to an after-tax profit of 1.18 billion on revenues of 17.99 billion in 1985. Evergreen has placed newbuilding orders for three 3,428-teu (twenty-foot equivalent unit) fully cellular container ships with the state-owned &lt;China Shipbuilding Corp> for delivery in late 1988.

BELGIAN ONE-DAY STRIKE HITS TRANSPORT, SHIPPING. A 24-hour strike by Belgian public employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted transport and hit ferry services and shipping, port and union officials said. Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were cancelled, the local news agency Belga said. An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle. Unions said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit. Few trains were running and some early morning flights by Sabena, Belgian's national airline, were cancelled.	ship
CHINA RESUMES USSR SHIP REPAIRS AFTER 23 YEAR GAP. China has resumed repairs of Soviet ships after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between the two countries. The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai, where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired. The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and Xingang last month. Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding Corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600 ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China's yards offered competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.	ship

HIGH WATER EXTENDS RHINE RIVER BLOCKAGE. Rising water levels on the Rhine caused by heavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise two sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation channel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authority spokesman said. He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting the sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830 cm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation might begin. Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels to travel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Cologne said. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms north of Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.	ship
RHINE BLOCKED FOR THREE MORE WEEKS - SALVAGER. Dutch salvage firm Smit-Tak said it may take some three weeks to lift the Swiss tug Orinoko and its lighter Pavo which sank 10 days ago at Karlsruhe in West Germany, blocking the Rhine river.

"U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF. The United States responded to an apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would play purely a deterrent role. ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters. He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran. Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, ""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us. ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."" The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf. The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks. Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome."" Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping."	ship

US SENATE CUTS OFF STALL TACTICS ON GULF BILL. Confronted by new hostilities involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later. The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue, including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.	ship
"SAUDI ROLE IN GULF PRAISED BY U.S. OFFICIALS. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said. ""The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"" said the official who asked not to be named. He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes. The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag. Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied, ""I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower."" The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement of the U.S. attack."	ship
"ITALY WORRIED AT RISING TENSION AFTER GULF ATTACK. Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased tension in the Gulf, but said America's retaliation against Iran had been limited. A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had been informed by the United States that it would take action against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil platform. ""The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"" the statement said. Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution. Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant shipping there."	ship

BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT. Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis), the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report. The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region. The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes -- 25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate. Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have affected quality, the report said. Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.	cotton

WORLD MARKET PRICE FOR UPLAND COTTON - USDA. The U.S. Agriculture Department announced the prevailing world market price, adjusted to U.S. quality and location, for Strict Low Middling, 1-1/16 inch upland cotton at 50.57 cts per lb, to be in effect through midnight April 16. The adjusted world price is at average U.S. producing locations (near Lubbock, Texas) and will be further adjusted for other qualities and locations.

CHINA WANTS TO BUY 5,000 TONNES PAKISTANI COTTON. China is negotiating with Pakistan to buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year, after importing the same amount last year under a barter agreement, Chinese consulate sources said. Chinese ambassador Tian Ding told a meeting of Pakistani industrialists on Thursday that China intended to increase imports from Pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance. Pakistani officials estimate the country's cotton output from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales (375 pounds each). Last year's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic consumption was just below three mln bales, they said.	cotton
"WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM. The West Texas cotton crop was largely unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts said. ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West Texas. Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning. Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents. ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and when that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc. Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which produces about 80 pct of that state's crop. The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the West Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said. ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been worse,"" Mohler said. About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said. The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about 95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said."	cotton
TANZANIAN COTTON THREATENED BY LACK OF STORAGE. About 60,000 tonnes of harvested raw cotton may be spoiled by rain in Tanzania's northern Shinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crude village sheds, radio Tanzania reported. The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full. Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it added. Agriculture Ministry officials have forecast a 1987/88 cotton harvest of about 200,000 tonnes, down from 215,000 in 1986/87.	cotton
S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE. A South African trade union is in dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland. The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could lead to job losses and affect wages. A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum prices rocketing.  The union said talks with management over the proposed move had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that no final decision had been taken on strike action. The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer. It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.	platinum
"PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991. Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson Matthey Plc said. Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest single application for platinum. Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces, Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released in London today. Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious. He said South Africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about 500,000 ounces to meet increased demand. The capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said. The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the 1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces, Clark said. ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said."	platinum

LME CLARIFIES NEW ALUMINIUM CONTRACT DETAILS. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade aluminium contract, in response to questions from members following the announcement of the contract, due to start June 1. All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract (min 99.5 pct), the LME said. Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant. The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50 cents for even tonnages only. Singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside Europe to be used as an LME delivery point, will be used for high grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners Steinweg will be 1.05 U.S. Dlr a tonne per week, the LME said. The LME Board, in response to representation from the trade, agreed to annul from LME contracts the minimum weight requirements of 450 kilos for T-bars and 250 kilos for sows, effective for high grade on June 1 and for standard on July 24.	alum

FORD &lt;F> DEVELOPING ALUMINUM CAR FRAME. Ford Motor Co said it is developing an aluminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extruded stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for building production cars in the future. It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford said.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and improving fuel economy. Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000 dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.	alum

VENEZUELA GETS 300 MLN DLRS CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM. Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said. 'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a television interview. He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state aluminum company Venalum. The credit will be divided into two separate agreements, one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct. Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in the state steel and petrochemical industries. Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of 5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank. The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last February. Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements. Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan bonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.	alum

INDONESIA RAISES STAKE IN ALUMINIUM PLANT. Indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud said. The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake. The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne. Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant, situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.	alum
JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM. Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said. Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested in the company. The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said. They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested. The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said. Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said. Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct. The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said. The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium. Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they said.	alum

CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland. The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said. The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22 mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key managers, he said. Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment in Victoria.

LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS. Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders said. Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said. The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks. In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession.	lead

The rate at which permits were issued for future construction fell 0.6 pct in September to a seasonally adjusted 1,493,000 units from 1,502,000 units in August. Permits had risen 1.0 pct in August from July levels of 1,487,000 units. Before seasonal adjustment, permits rose to 135,500 in September from 128,000 in August. Housing starts before adjustment rose to 150,200 in September from 144,600 in August. The seasonally adjusted rise in starts included a 5.1 pct increase in September single-family unit starts to 1,168,000 from 1,111,000 in August. Single-family starts had fallen 2.8 pct in August from July levels. Multi-family starts rose 2.9 pct in September to a seasonally adjusted 501,000 units after a 7.0 pct increase in August, the department said. Permits for single-family units fell 3.2 pct last month to a seasonally adjusted 990,000 units after a 3.0 pct August rise. Multi-family permits were up 5.0 pct in September to 503,000 units after falling 3.0 pct in August. Housing starts in September were down 1.2 pct from a seasonally adjusted 1,689,000 units in September 1986. Permits were 11.5 pct below the September 1986 level of 1,687,000 units.	housing
"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS. The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said. For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect."" The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion."" REUTER^M"	gnp
"WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS. The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990. In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year. But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created."" The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward."" The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks. However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open. The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies. The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government. They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax. The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged. They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies. The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts. The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost. The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said."	gnp
"BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS. West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks. In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned -- ""The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."" Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased. Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987, with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct. Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority."" He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because of a further increase in world trade."	gnp
ITALIAN GDP ROSE 2.4 PCT IN 1986 FOURTH QUARTER. Italy's Gross Domestic Product, calculated at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics Institute ISTAT said. ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy's budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985. Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire, down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said. Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986. Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter.	gnp
"INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION. The five leading West German economic research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany, their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said. The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986. Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, ""None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession."" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy . Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets. Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, ""The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year."""	gnp
"CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET. The Philippines' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier. ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,"" Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said. ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,"" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. ""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable."" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive. ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners,"" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups. ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said. ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,"" he said. ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts."""	gnp
"GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED. Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said. The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period. A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends. ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,"" he added. The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth. However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway. Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period. The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct. Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows. West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years. The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback. It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986."	gnp
PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES. Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments, investments and energy were causing concern. GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey. The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey. Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct. The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end. Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion. More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said. The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports. He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.	gnp
"GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS. The West German government's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said. A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable. It added the council believed ""an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for."" Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase. The government regularly uses the term ""changed external economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level. Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar. The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy. West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget. The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low. The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast. Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986."	gnp
"S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR. South Korea's gross national product (GNP) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters. Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable. The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct. GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures. GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986. In the first four months of this year, the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. ""What the Minister said does not imply any major economic policy change,"" a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. ""But he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic (future) ... A high won era."" South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar. The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986. The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation."	gnp
SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH. Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption. Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year. In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong. The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness. In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.	gnp
OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES. High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages. The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland. Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said. After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway. Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.	gnp

"FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW. Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s. ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years."	gnp
"U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS. The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say. Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent. ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says. ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"" Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,"" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve. ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. ""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said."	gnp
EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE. The outcome of today's European Community (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos, traders said. Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining factor in today's result, they added.	sugar

RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP. Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said. As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season. Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane. Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture. Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said. Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said. The cane crush normally runs from June to December.	sugar
FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST EC SUGAR TENDER. The European Community (EC) is expected to award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000 and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said. They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864. Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but declined to give a rebate figure.	sugar

Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes. Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy. Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks). Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.	sugar
"DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED. Roughly half of this year's expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start,"" he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A"" and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar."	sugar
EC COMMISSION DETAILS SUGAR TENDER. The EC Commission confirmed it granted export licences for 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar at a maximum export rebate of 46.496 European Currency Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos. Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.	sugar
EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY. The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said. The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions. Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low. Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.	sugar
CARGILL CONFIRMS WHITE SUGAR SALE TO INDIA. London-based trader Cargill (U.K.) Ltd confirmed it sold one cargo of white sugar to India for shipment April 15/May 15 at yesterday's tender.

WEST GERMAN BEET PLANTINGS DELAYED THREE WEEKS. Unseasonal cold weather has delayed sugar beet plantings in West Germany by up to three weeks, the agriculture ministry said. A ministry spokesman said in some central areas, especially in the Rhineland, farmers have taken advantage of warmer weather and started plantings in the past two days. West German planting intentions this year are put at 381,000 hectares, down from 390,500 ha last year, he said, adding that the 1980/1985 average was 405,000 ha.	sugar
U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL. Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a spokesman for Porter said. The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress last month. That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs. Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.	sugar
"SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM. A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people. Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents."	sugar
NORTH YEMEN BOUGHT WHITE SUGAR AT TENDER - TRADE. North Yemen at its weekend tender bought white sugar from a French operator acting on behalf of a Swiss house at 214.70 dlrs a tonne c and f, traders said.

PAKISTAN REPORTEDLY BOUGHT WHITE SUGAR AT TENDER. Pakistan is reported to have bought 100,000 tonnes of white sugar at its weekend tender from a North Korean operator, traders said. The purchase, believed priced around 210 dlrs a tonne cost and freight for fine/medium grain, was due to be shipped for arrival in May (30,000 tonnes), in June (45,000) and in July (25,000 tonnes), they said.	sugar
HAITIAN CANE PLANTERS PROTEST SUGAR MILL CLOSURE. About 2,000 sugar cane planters marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer. The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami. The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000 small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.	sugar
"CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS. China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said. ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem."" A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat said. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,"" he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market."" A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding imports was price. ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said. The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it."""	sugar
"FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED. Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said. Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing."" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis."" In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added."	sugar

Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was involved. China was still believed to be in the market for more sugar, traders said.	sugar
COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE. Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said. Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields. But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth. Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said. In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth. In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible. In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said. In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage. In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets. In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development. Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year.	sugar
FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK IN RAW SUGAR, WOODHOUSE SAYS. It has been a fairly hectic trading week in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby shipments, London trader, Woodhouse, Drake and Carey, said in its weekly report. July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New York futures, it said. Mid-week saw these same sales covered by the trade at 10/15 points discount. Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and here again, traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium to New York July up to 18, Woodhouse said. In the Western Hemisphere, both Dominican Republic and Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New York and offered five points under, but in limited trading, it said. All the action of the past week has been in the Far East raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect of nearby offtake, Whitehouse added.	sugar
UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET. British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a Reuter inquiry Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's hurricane which blocked roads. The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again. This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added. Other factories are continuing to process beet normally, but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas. Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes. Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2 mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the spokesman said. British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K. The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month, is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the campaign. As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13 pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has severely restricted beet lifting. Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet available.	sugar
"SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS. A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost vodka sales, Pravda said. The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into two billion bottles of moonshine. At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said, this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree. ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count home-brew,"" Pravda said. ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."" Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population."	sugar
"NEW ZEALAND IMPOSES SANCTIONS AGAINST FIJI. New Zealand has imposed sanctions against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said. The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year. Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures. ""We won't be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"" Palmer said. The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25. Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic. Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth had lapsed.

MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE. Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said. The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said. This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading centre. The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be discussed. Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva. The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.	rubber

"RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE. International Rubber Organisation (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it. ""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in proper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in September would be discussed at an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said. Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible poor quality. Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the ""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October 16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers' minds. ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying,"" he said. Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage. Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and see attitude"" by buyers, he said. ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive, they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially. Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur and New York since September. But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes. The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday. The current international rubber pact expires on October 22. The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period."	rubber
"STOLTENBERG NOT SURPRISED BY DOLLAR REACTION. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting of the International Monetary Fund he said, ""These minor movements don't really affect us."" The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around current levels."	dlr
"G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION. Top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they believe they strengthened in talks last week. Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar."" West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation, leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."" But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit. ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not (into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the dollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintained artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is not healthy."" And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession, he said. Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."" But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine. ""The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements,"" Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism. West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given the policy commitments summarized in this statement."" Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week's statement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S. Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit."	dlr

"SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION. Mines and Energy Minister Subroto confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not necessary. Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA. ""We can support extension of the sixth agreement,"" he said. ""But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary."" The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension."	tin
EC MAINLY FOR TIN EXTENSION, NO U.K. STAND TAKEN. European Community (EC) members of the International Tin Council, except Britain, have said they are prepared to back an extension of the International Tin Agreement, an EC spokesman said. He said at a meeting of EC states' representatives here yesterday, Britain undertook to communicate its own decision to its partners today. It said it was not ready yesterday to take a stand but did not say why. He added nine other EC states backed an extension. Spain and Portugal, which are not members of the International Tin Council, raised no objections to a common EC stance in favour.	tin
PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE. The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said. The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said. Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesday's at 4,790. The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985. The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said. The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes. The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various metal associations including the Association of White Metals.	tin
TALKS CONTINUE ON TIN AGREEMENT EXTENSION. Discussions on the possible extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member states. A number of producer governments in particular have not decided their final position on whether the ITA should be extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on June 30, according to delegate sources. Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later. Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC coordination meeting. The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor technical matters and the main issue will probably not be discussed before the afternoon session.	tin
SPOT TIN EASIER ON EUROPEAN FREE MARKET. Spot tin on the European free market was indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam, down 20 stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close. Stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said. Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May and June requirements but are holding out for even lower offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined to end April metal at 4,225 stg. Small-scale spot business was reported by West German operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market was still being undercut by Chinese material, which traded at one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.	tin
CONSENSUS SEEN ON TIN PACT EXTENSION. The quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged. Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour an extension, delegates said. This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to discuss internal matters. Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16. The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.	tin
"TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET. European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October. Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current ""free market"" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said."	tin
"ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE. The International Tin Council, ITC, intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence. The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the London Metal Exchange over its ""ring out"" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said. The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow. In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law. The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the European Community's legal advisers were due to attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today. Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters, delegates said. The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement. As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies, although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously. At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16."	tin
THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE. Thailand's major tin exporter and producer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines. Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters. He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3. The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985. Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day. As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988. Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said. The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however, because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month, Yoot said. The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.	tin
TIN COUNCIL ALLOWED APPEAL ON USE OF DOCUMENTS. Britain's highest court has decided the International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions. On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days. On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January, they added. The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988. The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council. Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule.	tin
FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES. The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset pressures from the end of the two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. Some also look for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.

"WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said. As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy. ""On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,"" Wojnilower said in a report. ""Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,"" Wojnilower said. He said last week's ""hiccup"" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts. Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said."	interest
"GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT. Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said. Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity."" Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

"LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES. Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when necessary."" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,"" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States."" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,"" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant."" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that ""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been ""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,"" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year."	interest

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE. Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate. They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.	interest

"U.S. SENATE LEADER CALLS FOR INTEREST RATE CUTS. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut interest rates. ""I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"" Bentsen told NBC Television's ""Meet the Press."" Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take ""billions off the debt service of the Latin countries"" and help ease protectionist pressures in the industrial countries. Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. ""You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus, enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation there,"" he said. Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.

U.S. BILL AUCTION RATES AVERAGE 5.98, 6.08 PCT. The U.S. Treasury said its weekly auction of three-month bills produced an average rate of 5.98 pct, with a 6.08 pct rate on six-month bills.

"BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES. White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might ""overreact"" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year. ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. ""I'm concerned about the Fed's overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply."" Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate. Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have ""political consequences."" The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year. ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said. Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit. Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar. Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects. U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States."	interest

BUNDESBANK REPORTED TO HAVE NO PLAN FOR RATE CUT. Bundesbank Deputy President Helmut Schlesinger said the West German central bank had no plan to cut its three pct discount rate, Nihon Keizai newspaper reported. The financial daily quoted Schlesinger as saying in an interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest rate levels for the time being. He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange rates are stable. Earlier, Schlesinger told a press conference that the Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term interest rates at a low level for currency stability. He also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal for the West German economy.	interest
WINDOW FOR BANK AID IN KUWAIT REMAINS SHUT. The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said. The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher, with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct. There were few offers in a tight market and traders scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct but there was little activity at the longer end of the market. Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf. The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut in the dinar exchange rate. Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from 0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.	interest
U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN. Representatives of major U.K. Based banks are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources said. The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.  The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.  On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.	interest

BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES. The Belgian National Bank said it cut one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by 0.10 points, effective immediately.

A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct discount rate. The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main monetary policy instrument for the last two years. The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.

"U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS. Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K. In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than for a good number of years. ""It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively,"" he said. ""We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation,"" he added. Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry. ""But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time,"" he added. Base rate is currently nine pct."	interest
"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES. More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates. And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds. ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans. ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product."" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years."	interest
"UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES. The six basis point rise of the past month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the dollar holds firm. ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month, largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"" Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said. September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May 18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level. ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar,"" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement. However, a successful auction could prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market psychology."	interest

"BANK OF JAPAN DETERMINED TO KEEP EASY MONEY POLICY. The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy, central bank officials said. ""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of the fact that we have not changed our policy stance,"" a senior central bank official told Reuters. The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today, the officials said. The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices, the officials said. But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid was 3.75 pct, they said. The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said. The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy. ""We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further,"" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain. ""If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being,"" he said."	interest

U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY. The Treasury Department said it notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948 income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury said in a two-sentence announcement. The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands over the past eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman said. The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the spokesman said. Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the spokesman said. He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance at lower interest rates. However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced with lower yields.	interest

Poehl says German and international interest rate rises are cause for concern.  Poehl says German and international interest rate rises are cause for concern	interest
"POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN. Rises in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said. ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"" Poehl told an investment conference. ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates,"" he said. Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and currency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures. The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention, he said."	interest
"TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY. Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said. A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to support the stock and security markets,"" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said. ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,"" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said."	interest

CHEMICAL &lt;CHL>, MARINE MIDLAND &lt;MM> CUT PRIME. Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just last week. The reduction is effective immediately. No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at 9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market rates would take. Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices, money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the economy and the financial system. Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16 percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday), and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.	interest
"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA. An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said. An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending. ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said. ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"" said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales,"" Temperton said. ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added. ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments."	interest

U.K. EARNINGS UP UNDERLYING 7.75 PCT IN APRIL. U.K. Average earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 6.5 pct in the year to end-April, after increasing by 6.7 pct annually in March, the Employment Department said. The April index, base 1980, was set at a provisional, seasonally-adjusted 197.3, up from 194.8 in March. But the underlying rise was 7.75 pct, up 0.25 pct from March and back to the same level seen late last year. The underlying rise is adjusted for factors such as back-pay and timing variations. Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose one pct in the year to April, after an upward revised rise of 0.7 pct in the period to March, the Department of Employment added.

"U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL. The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,"" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. ""An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy."	crude

CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S.. Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline. The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices. Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct. Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices. Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week. For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts.

ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH. Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said. Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco.

"TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED. Texaco Inc has re-established some key oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations. ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"" Yates told Reuters in an interview. The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity."" He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week."" He declined to identify the company. &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business. ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub. ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."" But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished."	crude

""The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies. ""The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. ""More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,"" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer."	crude
DOE RESOLVES ISSUES WITH ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> UNIT. The Energy Department said it had approved in final form an agreement that resolves all remaining issues with Shell Oil Co over oil pricing and allocation controls that ended in 1981. Under the agreement, The Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit agreed to pay 20 mln dlrs to settle refiner pricing issues and 160 mln dlrs to settle crude oil pricing issues, DOE said. DOE said that before making the pact final, it modified it to reflect Shell's compliance with the Tertiary Incentive Program, a provision not in the version published last Dec 31.	crude
"ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT. A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,"" he said. ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,"" he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment."" He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products."	crude

"TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET. U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but opinions are divided on the impact to the market. ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added. Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing. However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry,"" one New York trader said. ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"" he added. Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said. Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy. Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades. New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble."	crude
ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION. Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.	crude
SAUDI ARABIA WANTS TO INCREASE OIL SALES TO JAPAN.

He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to Japan to earlier levels, but did not elaborate. To promote trade, Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese industries to do business there, he said. Japanese firms now have long-term contracts to import a total of 150,000 barrels per day of Saudi crude.	crude
"ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS. Ecuador will use a new pipeline link with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years, Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said. The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared with what we are going to earn."" OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month, Espinosa said."	crude
"PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE. Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,"" he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output. ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said. ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained,"" he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer."""	crude
"SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG. Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged. The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation. Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them. But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul,"" he said. Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price. Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco. Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia."	crude

COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE. Norway is expected to seek a compromise solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said. The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s. Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved. It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco. Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway.	crude

"MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS. Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed. ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company source said. The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood. ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."" The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's operator. Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away.  The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby."	crude
"CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF. Rep. Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis. Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency. The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff. Synar said, ""the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis."" Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects."	crude
TOTAL PETROLEUM &lt;TPN> SHUTS TEXAS PIPELINES. Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut down several small crude oil pipelines operating near the Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger, manager of operations. Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said. The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd, run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today. One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said. He said the closed pipelines run under river water and could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks and expose the piping. Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to recede before they reactivate the pipelines.	crude

LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS. The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said. Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.	crude

"MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS. The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete. ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River. The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said. The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.

COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES.

There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN). According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986. The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage. In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults. Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.

Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said. Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct. Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling. Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies.

"OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS. Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a ""package."" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna. ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said."	crude

U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS. The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible, the Press Association reported. The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig. An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable. It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said. Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole. The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.	crude

SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT. Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000 tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters. They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval. CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price. Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh. Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments. Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable. CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.	crude
"OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. ""I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"" Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which starts June 25. ""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review,"" Lukman said. The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable. ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far,"" Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December. ""Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong,"" he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members. Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength."	crude

"U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING. U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session. They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing. ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output. ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil. ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts. ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said."	crude
UNOCAL&lt;UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT. Unocal Corp said it told the U.S. Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado due to high costs. Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said. Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs, compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs. The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said. Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees, Unocal said. The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.	crude

"FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY. OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said. ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner said. The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs. ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday. ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said one international oil trader in Tokyo. ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,"" he added. One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said. Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast. Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,"" an oil industry analyst said."	crude
SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR. The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has retired at his own request, oil industry sources said. They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port.	crude

Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support OPEC's moves to boost oil prices.

"NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY. Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told Reuters. ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"" he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution."" The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit. Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production."	crude
"EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE. Following are extracts from the communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference here. ""The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels. ""The conference noted that all market indicators, including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."" ""The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."" ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure. ""Should there be any significant change in market prices, the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year, which would secure the desired market stability."" ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986, both in terms of official price, and national production, levels. ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement.""  ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability. The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries. ""The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference.""

Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting.  Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes."" Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister."" Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes."	crude
"IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA. Iraq has rejected its new OPEC production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported. It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who returned Sunday, as saying ""Iraq will continue to adhere to its position considering itself as not included in the agreement.""  Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987 quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255 mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly seven-year-old Gulf war. The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and Iran's to 2.369 mln."	crude
"CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS. A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said. Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch surface choke. ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled. ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well. ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced. ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,"" Osborne said. Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd."	crude
"ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER. Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference. Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said. ""We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months,"" he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved. ""They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,"" he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported. While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said."	crude
VENEZUELA BUDGET SEES 16.35 DLRS OIL PRICE. Venezuela's government tomorrow presents a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said. Azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new budget projects ordinary income of 149.925 billion bolivars and extraordinary income of 34.186 billion. Oil revenues are expected to produce 92.014 billion, or 61 pct of the total. The finance minister said the oil revenue projection is based on an average price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel in 1988. Venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16. 20 dlrs per barrel, according to the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A.	crude
"VENEZUELA SEES FLAT OIL PRICE DESPITE U.S. ATTACK. World oil prices would remain stable despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday. He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal. Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference. Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued. Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were ""overproducing in an exaggerated manner"" above their assigned quotas, he said. OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd."	crude
"MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988.

""We have the capacity to produce the amount,"" Rastam Hadi, Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said. The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market.

IRAN SAYS U.S. RAID CAUSED 500 MLN DLRS DAMAGE. U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying. The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf, the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters, were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.	crude
"INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS. Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas. ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto said. ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,"" he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration. ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,"" Subroto said. ""The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis."" Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."" Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested."	crude
NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER. Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days.	crude

IRAN, SOVIETS TO HOLD TALKS ON OIL EXCHANGE DEAL.

SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES. The Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year's planned output. Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament. He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983. Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln. January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million. Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry. The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.	crude
"US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS. U.S. military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said. U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf. ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire. ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.  In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf. ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,"" Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures."""	crude
OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF SALE POSTPONED. Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively schedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S. Department of Interior said.

Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March, Powers said.

"EX-ARCO &lt;ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990.

Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear. ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979."" Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb. ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""

"AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT. Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said. December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said."	crude
"SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS TALKS AFTER GULF ATTACK. The U.N. Security Council was called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform. Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans. In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N. Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right of self-defense. The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but was trying to find out ""what actually happened."" Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response."	crude

"TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM. The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration. Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs. Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension. Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year. Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials."""	crude

SOUTH YEMEN PLANS OIL EXPORT PIPELINE - MEES. South Yemen is planning a major oil pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. MEES said government approval for the export pipeline followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly finished and construction is expected to start early next year, the industry newsletter said. The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles) from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the Gulf of Aden, MEES said. MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity. The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.	crude
STATOIL PLACES NORTH SEA VESLEFRIKK FIELD ORDERS. Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field, has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a statement. Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said. Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S &lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig. Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned. Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen. Statoil estimates the field's total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas. Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields. Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S> (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> (nine pct) and &lt;Svenska Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).	crude
IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS. The Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said. Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union. Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf. Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow. Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products. Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.	crude
"COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE. A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee. Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called ""mental hostages"" to coffee, traditionally Colombia's major export.

COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70/80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS. International coffee prices could drop to between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next October if no agreement is reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said. Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the reasons was that the market was already saturated and that producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln (60-kg) bags in 1987.

On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount. Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years. He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia.

UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES. Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said. The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production. CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.	coffee

Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five central american nations will participate in the two-day strategy session beginning May 4. The main topic will be reform of what many producing countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export quotas, Fernandez said. He said Costa Rica would press for quotas ""based on the real production and export potential of each country in the past few years"" and to distribute quotas based on ""historic"" production levels rather than recent harvests and crop estimates."	coffee

"RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA. European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation. ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said. However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said. ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"" one official said. ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,"" he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, "" he said. ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one trader said. ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,"" the official said."	coffee
IBC DETAILS PLANS TO PAY CREDITORS.

He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money and added that a Reuter report on June 16 gave the wrong impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the 15 mln dlrs. No date has yet been set for the auction.	coffee
"EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA. European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said. ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone."" Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, "" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,"" van Horick added."	coffee
"COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.. A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers. Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas. ""There is one country which evidently still does not,"" Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas. Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict. He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials. While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a ""positive letter,"" Rosenbaum said. The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan. Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders. Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement. The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless ""objective criteria"" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits."	coffee

""When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."" The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February. Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries. ""We have sacrificed a great deal already,"" he said. ""this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours."""	coffee
"U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED. A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources. ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one analyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said. ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a U.S. Customs spokesman said. ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),"" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system. ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster. ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands."" Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled. According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans. ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term. ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat,"" one trader said."	coffee
IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS. The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said. He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction. Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion. The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said. He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form. Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday. A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added. A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.	coffee

UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE. Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said. A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October. He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris. Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year. Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement. In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said. The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of which is used to produce instant coffee.	coffee

"DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY. A major animal feed producer, Cehave NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the application of the European Community grain co-responsibility levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive Peter Pex told Reuters. Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However, that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain. ""We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency, has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"" Pex said. ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route, but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option even though it could take years,"" Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted. Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case brought by the Association of European Animal Feed Manufacturers, FEFAC."	meal-feed

"CANADA LUMBER EXPORTS MAY BECOME UNPROFITABLE. Canada's softwood lumber will become unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs, Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters. Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail duty. ""I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so I think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"" Zimmerman said at a media briefing. Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada first, migrating westward. ""The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off when times get tough,"" Zimmerman said.

"JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE. Japanese oil companies are starting campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources said. Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20. Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year. Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said. ""We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption,"" Showa Shell said. Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said. High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total gasoline sales in Japan, it added. Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100. Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales. The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years. ""Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas,"" an official at a major oil company said. An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness. Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil, Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.

COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY. Columbia Gas Transmission corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts. Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985.

"BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE. Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said. Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987, analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies. In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a Brooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through to rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings, end-users, especially residential and commercial customers, will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, high cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>, Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering firm, said. ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge, he said. ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it may take a while."""	nat-gas

"TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS. Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also transport its own gas to customers. Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell. The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access. Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to open-access because of the take-or-pay issue. But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the steps FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even before all transitional problems are solved."" A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from Louisiana and Texas up to New England.

Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax. Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries. They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides. They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports. ""We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,"" Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only ""as a very last resort,"" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan. Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats. Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says."	veg-oil
"DUTCH PARLIAMENT BACKS STAND AGAINST OILS TAX. Dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats, parliamentarians said. A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S. And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World countries. State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties. ""It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance. The EC members have to make a choice,"" Van Der Linden said. However, he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position."	veg-oil
RPT - OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX INTACT - MINISTER. A minority group of European Community countries strong enough to block the adoption of a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact after the EC Commission proposed changes to its proposals earlier today, British agriculture minister John MacGregor told journalists. He said Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark continue to oppose the tax after the Commission proposed making it temporary and promising compensation to any third countries whose exports suffered.	veg-oil
"DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT. Dutch consumers and food processors would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick de Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats and oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting. The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC. The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said. ""A move by these industries to countries outside the EC cannot be ruled out,"" he added. De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely expensive administratively. He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Lome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty. The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment, he added."	veg-oil
"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX. A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy."" The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill"" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime. ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added."	veg-oil
"EC PRESIDENCY PREPARED TO DROP OILS AND FATS TAX. Belgium, current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price package, diplomats said. In a discussion document prepared for today's summit meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called ""stabilising mechanism"" be the subject of ""further study and consultation with the Community's main trading partners."" The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism. The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure. Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Spain. Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting."	veg-oil
"EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT. European Community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission spokesman said. He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord. The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of ""dynamic"" moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers. These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC sources said. Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources said. EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats. In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system. Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax."	veg-oil
"FRANCO-GERMAN PARLEY FAILS TO UNBLOCK FARM TALKS. A specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis. ""The Germans clearly do not want to budge,"" an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting. Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex ""green"" currrency system, designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies. Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands. EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow. Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks. The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget. The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987."	veg-oil
"LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY. The United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week. ""We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance,"" Lyng said. ""At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable,"" he said. There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law. Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food. ""The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that,"" Lyng said. ""We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them,"" he said. Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials during Gandhi's visit here, adding, ""I just don't know of anything that might be announced specifically."" Asked if ""the ball was in the Indians' court,"" he said, ""Yes."" Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening."	veg-oil
COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS. The European Community's farmers' pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission. Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes. He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues. Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers. This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions. A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC price fixing. However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax. Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices.	veg-oil
WEATHER HURTS ITALIAN ORANGES - USDA REPORT. Unfavorable weather conditions during the second week of March caused damage to oranges in the Calabria region in southern Italy, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Rome said in a field report. The report, dated April 3, said the region accounts for about 22,000 hectares of the Italian orange crop or about 26 pct of total production. However, orange production in the region for marketing year 1986/87 is forecast at 565,000 tonnes or 25 pct of the total Italian orange crop, it said. The report said trade contacts agree that about 15 pct of the orange output in Calabria was damaged by frost.	orange

U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE. The U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice. The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in its final ruling on the matter. Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator said. The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer -- Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S. supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986, the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said. Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said. An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22. Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties, Vastagh said. He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters, including three major shippers, would be affected by the decision.	orange

U.S. COURT UPHOLDS APEX DECISION FAVORING NYMEX. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit by Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange and several oil companies. The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursue anititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations against Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp &lt;CGP>. Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several companies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange, knowing Apex could not make full delivery.  The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of heating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apex eventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages. Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham and Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to pursue its case against Belcher Oil. The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against Apex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and 15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEX spokeswoman.	heat
U.K. MARCH PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.3 PCT. The price index for sales of manufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted 0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February, Department of Trade and Industry figures show. The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7 pct fall in February. The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer prices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February. The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was put at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February. The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted, was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6. The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the Department said. The Department said these falls were only partly offset by a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials. The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2 pct rise between February and March. Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in March after a 2.8 pct drop in February.	wpi
U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES. U.K. Producer price data for March were roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts said. The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from February and close to the average for the last six months. The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct in February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last year. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to rises in the index rather than falls.	wpi

HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT. Hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit. The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said. MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances. Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to 47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between 30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion. A major tax reform, including the introduction of a Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in an effort to cure problems in state spending. But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's deficit under control. The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said. The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.	cpi

PORTUGUESE CONSUMER PRICES UP 1.4 PCT IN MARCH. Portugal's consumer prices rose 1.4 pct in March after a one pct increase in February and a 1.2 pct rise in March 1986, the National Statistics Institute said. The consumer price index (base 100 for 1976) rose to 772.0 from 761.3 in February and compared with 703.4 in March 1986. This gave a year-on-year March inflation rate of 9.8 pct against 9.5 pct in February and 12.2 pct in March 1986. Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in March was 10.9 pct compared with 11.1 pct in February. The government forecasts annual inflation of about eight pct this year.	cpi
NEW ZEALAND CPI RISES 2.3 PCT IN MARCH QUARTER. New Zealand's consumer price index, CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December 1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the Statistics Department said. For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement. Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was contributed by the housing group, the department said. The December quarter was significantly affected by the introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax, GST, in October 1986, it added. However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986 quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said. This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information, particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household contents, it added.	cpi
OECD CONSUMER PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY. Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique. The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986. Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier, it said. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February, in line with previous months, although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain. Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.	cpi

Peru's consumer price index rose 5.9 pct in May to 15,706.5 (base 1979) compared to 6.6 pct in April and 3.3 pct in May 1986, the National Statistics Institute said. It said accumulated inflation for the first five months of this year was 33.8 pct against 24.1 pct for the same period in 1986. Inflation for the year ending May 1987 was 75.7 pct compared to 76.8 pct for the year ending May 1986.	cpi

PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE. The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said. The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week. The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP). The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month. Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month. In the first three months of the year, inflation was a negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5 and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics Office said. The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September respectively, the National Statistics Office said. It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices. The government's six and eight peso wage increases would displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.	cpi

CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986. Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years. Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices. Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985. Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year. Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.	earn

Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs. Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments.

"VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW. Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company's new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. ""Anything else would be more than a surprise,"" one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985."	earn

J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING. J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	earn

In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. ""Many other markets maintain restrictions,"" he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. ""Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage,"" he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

MONTEDISON'S AGRIMONT UNIT 1986 EARNINGS. &lt;Montedison SPA> of Italy said net consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June 1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986. Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's board of directors.

"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION. Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money."	earn

"MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH. Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30, 1988. At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs. In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs, or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs. Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line. Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988. He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases,"" he said. Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988, from 40 pct in fiscal 1987. He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995. Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg, borrow or steal to get into new markets."" In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers. ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry."" Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said the company intends to diversify internally and through acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise, such as drug delivery systems. Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions from an acquisition."" Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988. The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical activity. Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a rate responsive pacemaker."	earn

SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS. Showboat Inc will take a charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters. He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well. But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988 should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the contribution of the new Atlantic City facility. Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs. Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest as it had been able to do previously. Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming was completed earlier in the week.	earn
SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL. Security Pacific Corp said it is placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after taxes. Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings, Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share reported for the first quarter of 1986. The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador. Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since February. In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the country's export revenues. In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash. The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987. The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.	earn

In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.

Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any of its divisions. He added, ""We have the financial capacity to take advantage of acquisitions."" In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10 redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta, Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.

GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA. General Electric Corp said its first quarter results were significantly higher due to the strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year. General Electric also attibuted continued strong performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter. GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624 mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or 1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago. General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results are in line with those expectations. General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for its strong earnings. It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike. Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said. In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products. General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after taxes from an inventory accounting change. And technical products revenues and operating profit were ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's communications and related services.	earn

Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in 1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46 billion in 1985. In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07 dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year. The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of changes tariff and federal tax rates. The company's gas marketing business is expected to have somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year. Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a 2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.	earn

"PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT. The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co &lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters. Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos. He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. ""The exercise should make our stock more marketable,"" Lazo said. ""Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."" PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange. Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15. PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985. At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders. A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt. The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision. PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014 telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments in the country.

"CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN. Credit Commercial de France &lt;CCFP.PA> reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its denationalisation around the end of this month. Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad. Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982. The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch. So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation. The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. ""The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"" CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.

The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and Australian dollar and sterling. Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said. The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985. The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences, tighter interest margins and increased investment. Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the previous year. The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.

AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS. Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.	earn

Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.

Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any specific takeover attempt. Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one share of the company's common stock. The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result in 20 pct ownership, the company said. Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in connection with certain transactions afterward. The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1, 1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said. Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed to stockholders.	earn

"VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES. Losses for Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit."" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks."	earn

"NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN. National Distillers and Chemical Corp expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>. National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance of orders. ""I think the sales price was higher than most people expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group. A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts per share last year, including the spirits and wine business ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry. National Distillers sold its wine business last month to Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs. Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor businesses. Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year. National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine businesses, moving more into the chemical area. For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was 67 cts per share."	earn

SONY CHAIRMAN FORECASTS LOWER PROFITS THIS YEAR. Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio Morita said Sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a result of the dollar's decline.

The total excluded losses of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations. Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms manufacturing or handling. ""We could do a large acquisition,"" he said when asked if the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this purpose. Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to pursue an acquisition. ""If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can move with a certain expediency,"" Sinclair said.

However, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985.

"TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE. Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code will not affect the majority of its businesses. It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property, plant and equipment, were free of the action. Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are affected, it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to the Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit. ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive officer, told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added. Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said. Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full."	earn
ANZ BANK SETS ONE-FOR-TWO BONUS ISSUE. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered June 2. The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement. The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said. The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged capital at about the level of its last full year ended September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln dlrs in all for that year. Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the market price. The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1.	earn
MORGAN CRUCIBLE SAYS PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING. Morgan Crucible Co Plc &lt;MGCR.L> said the prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales significantly up on last year in all divisions. It said there were good opportunities for growth in both existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth by acquisition in related areas.

Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half. Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one mln stg, it noted. Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results were nonetheless disappointing. Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.

"COOPERVISION &lt;EYE> FORMS RECAPITALIZATION PLAN. Coopervision Inc said it is preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for common stock. The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at the company's annual meeting on June 22. The meeting had been postponed from its original date of May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization options, it said. In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and its year ago quarter. Income from continuing operations was not immediately availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs. At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference, Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for shareholders. He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35 dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his position. ""The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold his position and has never recovered,"" Montgomery said. The company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4. Montgomery further told the conference, ""Don't be an investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988.""

NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year. NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe and Pacific marketing groups. Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said. First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from 960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year. NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific figures.

"FOSTER &lt;FWC> UNIT AUDIT REVEALS DISCREPANCIES. Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed ""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may require material adjustments to previously announce consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries. Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not know the names of the president and controller, and could not immediately comment on the release. Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a period of several years and continuing through part of the first quarter of 1987."" Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary. The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not ""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to prior periods had not been determined. Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.

CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES. Chemical New York Corp said its first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed 1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual. Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax. A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual, Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or 4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs. Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest income by 1.5 mln dlrs. Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from 3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's cost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from 27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs from 26.2 mln. Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5 mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said. The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7 mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with 594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier. Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35 billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of March, 1986.	earn

It had a loss of 4,504,000 dlrs for fiscal 1986 ended November 30, compared to a fiscal 1985 loss of 1,732,00 dlrs.

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES. National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier. The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual. Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates. Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986. Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status. The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

"TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM>. International Business Machines Corp has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop a two-year earnings slump. ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen Smith. ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added. At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an even dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be felt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computer line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers, which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will emerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than he has been for nearly a year. ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"" Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said. ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith. A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected first-quarter results, analysts said. ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of Washington-based Weil and Associates. Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding, ""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""

IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL. Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status. Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62. Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax. Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on these loans during the remainder of 1987. Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses, although these were partly offset by increased trust income, profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities gains, the bank said. The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from 185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was 21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.	earn

"GTE &lt;GTE> CITES LOSS OF SPRINT. GTE Corp said the decline in its first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its 50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.

Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of Sprint. Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0 mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago. Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, ""we expect US Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance telecommunications. The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the fraudalent use of the network.

He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.

"HONEYWELL &lt;HON> CITES COST CUTTING FOR GAIN. Honeywell Inc said a gain of 20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the result of cost cutting efforts which began last year. Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or 79 cts in the same period a year ago. Better operating results in each of the company's three sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said. ""Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our businesses are producing better results than last year, even though we do not see significant improvement in the external market environment,"" he said. Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially, with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said. Domestic industrial automation and control orders were modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said. Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international markets, it said.

AMERICAN CENTURY &lt;ACT> RESTATES EARNINGS. American Century Corp said it has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000 dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs. The company said the change came after talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement in considering the five mln dlrs collectible. In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible, making its loan loss provision less than required. The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986 was adequate and that it has considered all relevant information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr receivable. But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff would not be in its best interest.	earn

DART GROUP DROPS DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH> TAKEOVER BID. Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> affiliate Madison Partners said that given current market conditions it has dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp. The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of Dayton Hudson stock. It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson shares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said. Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders. Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company. Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at 27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2. Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton Hudson. A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the market today.	earn

U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED. Trading on the London potato futures market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement to floor members. It was in response to strong representations by the Potato Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of price which they say will result in large deliveries into the physical market when the April futures position expires. The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the relationship between futures and physicals. Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other parties, found no evidence to substantiate this. The main complaint from some sections of the physical market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's average price of 104 stg. Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser quality grades have traded below 100 stg. Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered against the April futures contract between now and the end of the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market. Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.	potato

WORLD BANK TO SUPPORT SRI LANKA IF DEFICITS CUT. The World Bank will support Sri Lanka's development program provided the country reduces its budget and current account deficits, the Ministry of Finance said. It said Bank President Barber Conable at a meeting with Sri Lanka's Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel in Washington also emphasised the need for structural adjustment and reform to the economy, battered by five years of separatist disturbances. Officials said Sri Lanka's budget deficit this year is expected to surpass the projected 28.7 billion rupees while defence spending, already up by two billion rupees from a targetted 10 billion, is also likely grow. The Ministry said de Mel asked the World Bank to give Sri Lanka 6.5 billion rupees balance of payments support.	bop
SPAIN HAS 35 MLN DLR CURRENT SURPLUS FEBRUARY. Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank of Spain figures show. Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986. Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs. Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said. Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655 mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and 502 mln dlrs in February last year.	bop
BELGIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN 1986. Belgium's current account surplus, measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance Ministry said. The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion. The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion. Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.	bop
"SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR. South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said. Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow. ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,"" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986. ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said. The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs. The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said. ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said. Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. ""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,"" he said. He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won."" The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986."	bop

ITALY SHOWS SEPTEMBER OVERALL PAYMENTS SURPLUS. Italy's overall balance of payments showed a 919 billion lire surplus in September against a deficit of 1,026 billion in August, provisional Bank of Italy figures showed. The September surplus compared with a shortfall of 1,697 billion lire in September 1986. For the first nine months of 1987, the overall balance of payments showed a deficit of 1,921 billion lire against a 1,725 billion deficit in the same 1986 period. The central bank said Italy's one billion dlr Eurobond launched last month contributed to September's surplus.	bop
"S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS. South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap, said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the country's cheap cars and electronic goods. Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own figures later in the week. Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled 7.03 billion dlrs. This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid revaluation of the won against the dollar. The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier. ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said. The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous month. More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers, electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest between July and September. The South Korean government originally targeted a five billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export boom. If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with Seoul last year, government economists said. The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to American goods and revalue the won faster. The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday, representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year."	bop

FED'S HELLER SEES RETURN TO SLOWER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH.  FED'S HELLER SEES RETURN TO SLOWER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH	money-supply
"FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER. Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects ""more modest levels"" of growth in the money supply this year. ""In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development,"" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif. A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. ""Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels,"" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January. ""I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well,"" he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. ""The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,"" he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would ""generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector"" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers. ""A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,"" Heller warned. He said ""we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."" Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes. ""The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,"" Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada. A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada ""would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country,"" Heller said."	money-supply

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS. U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said. Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591 mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln dlrs in the first week of the period. Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of 447 mln dlrs. A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in the week ended Wednesday. Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for 65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90 pct of the borrowing. Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28. Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday. The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems. About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve bank. As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday, when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction was made to unposted funds at a single bank. In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday, banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week but ran a deficit on Wednesday. In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.	money-supply

"FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY. U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said. ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so. ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy.

AUSTRALIA'S M-3 MONEY SUPPLY RISE 1.5 PCT IN MARCH. Australia's M-3 money supply growth was 1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the Reserve Bank said. This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February. The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd. The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77 billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986. M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.	money-supply

CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS. A representative of the poultry industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or salads and other mixed foods. Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an increase in outbreaks of the disease. May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct of outbreaks and dairy products six pct. May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods. May said the chicken industry favored moving away from bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination of poultry. However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness. Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.	carcass
"EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS. A former U.S. Agriculture Department official urged the department to require that packages of chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to protect the public from disease. Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, ""every hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken contaminated with salmonella."" She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over the past several years. Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness. She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal contamination and that chiller water be changed more often. Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove ""disastrous."" He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection techniques should be overlaid."	carcass

"U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN. The U.S. meat industry has launched an aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to relax current beef import quotas. U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export Federation said at a press conference today. Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April. ""The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,"" said Philip Seng, Asian Director for the Federation. ""We supply and they (Japan) buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to buy more,"" he said. Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S. imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding U.S. beef shipments to Japan. The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get underway this fall. The Reagan administration has called for an end to the quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure. Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota. High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry officials said. Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S. tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb. Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American, officials said. Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln tonnes."	carcass
"SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER. Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. ""We'll be back in position in first place within three years,"" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,"" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said Kleinwort's Smithson. ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong."""	acq

"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS. A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of fiduciary duties."" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial."" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now."" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985."	acq

"PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION. Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year."	acq

"DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR. &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. ""As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors,"" spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. ""All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors,"" he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer.

"TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>. The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors."" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"" said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make,"" she said. ""You look at their record over the year, and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past,"" Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

"UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY. UAL Inc may have a response this afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said. ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released today. The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares. ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer. ""The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"" said Pettee. ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's something for everybody,"" he said."	acq

However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached. The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by April 23."" Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""

"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS. A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer."	acq

"BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM. Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc>. Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock. The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures. As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company. A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co. James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community."" Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements. The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered. Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments. Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount. The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity. Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock. The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately."	acq

"TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS. A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers. Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd> which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>. Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981."	acq

The rights will expire April Nine. The company said the rights would be exercisable 20 business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more. Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40 pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice the rights' exercise price. If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the rights' exercise price, the company said. Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within 180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt, five years after issuance. Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to any known effort to acquire control of it.

"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS. A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer."	acq
"SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>. Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns, would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April 8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender, each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer, or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval, a process that it already underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date."	acq

"GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID. GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's stock. ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard Henderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill Lynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones, computer terminals, and appliances. ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days,"" said Henderson. ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,"" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share. ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said Rose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."" ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>."	acq

I think that we still need to be building as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian management."" He said he did not know who other possible bidders were. Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in order ""will remove one of the general problems of attitude that have hung over Western Canadian industry.""

"DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION. Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the debt-heavy company. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum."" ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks with Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10 dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada would own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"" he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87 billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand. ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"" Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of 2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the largest ever by a Canadian company."	acq

Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities, if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said it was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it was conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in the tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their positions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130 mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of subordinated discount debentures. GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.	acq

AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>, REPORT SAYS. Amoco Corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a published report. The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.	acq

Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.	acq

"COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM. Computer Associates International Inc's 800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street analysts said. ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly present a much stronger front,"" he said. Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed, power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City, N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also, Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share. At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses, only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services unit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market, where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore, he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing and research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.  Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang."	acq

Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N' Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs per share in cash. Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.  Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we may add a bank to that."" ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was ""nominal."" Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock.  Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."" Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. ""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and Bilzerian's plan."	acq

"USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID. share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said. ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on earnings estimates. USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at 48-1/8, down 3/8. USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board would meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential. The industry has grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at 15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said. Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable business and win cost-control benefits, he said. ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said. Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer was ""grossly inadequate."""	acq

New York investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc &lt;DTX.T>, who are currently seeking to acquire Burlington Industries Inc in a hostile tender offer, said they lowered their stake in the company. In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares, reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33 pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct. The group said the sale, which represented all the Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.

"ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER. A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid. The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"" ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place."" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading. Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50."	acq

"INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC. The investor group that has agreed to buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors, industry analysts said. ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again,"" he said. Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of International Data.  Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent."	acq

"BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW. U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt.  That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to ""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer."	acq

"HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DEBENTURES MAY TRIGGER SUIT.

The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified, said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares to common stock by the June eight record date for a special dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better for them to continue holding the debentures.  ""There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation if we don't get answers,"" said a Wall Street source. Officials of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to acquire Harcourt.

When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight record date for the company's special dividend.

Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement. As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base. The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances. ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment. ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added. Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid. He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids. As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder, Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing. CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture. CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week.	acq

Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible.

The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986. Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.

"CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER. CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters. ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed bid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.  Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.  ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said. ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.""  Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.  ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid."	acq

"JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS. U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by Samjens Acquisition Corp. ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by attorneys for 1-1/2 days. ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much information as I have been. I have to consider what's been presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be winners,"" he said. Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally obtained confidential information about the company to make its offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada, were to succeed. Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share. Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid 72 dlrs per share for Burlington. Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would ""kill the offer"" Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."" Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in this for the money,"" he said. Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o takeover of Burlington.

ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS. Allegis Corp said it has created a limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the public. It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350 mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of September.

Allegis reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that partnership.

Spectra-Physics Inc said it is considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring, or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base salary if they stay with the company through August 29. In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid, citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders' investment in the company,"" the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will consider are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32 dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of dividends, Spectra-Physics said. The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the (Ciba-Geigy) offer."" Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29, but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the company because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in violation of securities law and with violating the intent of July 9, 1985 standstill agreement. Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20 pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat. Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.

"DAIRY FARM BIDS 146.6 MLN STG FOR 22 PCT KWIK SAVE. &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK.L> of Britain for a total 146.6 mln stg. Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik Save shares at 4.50 stg each. The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25 pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares. The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30, requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at least 15 pct. Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing 89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd &lt;JARS.HK> at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs. The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.

"GOVERNMENT TO SELL 25 PCT OF AIR NEW ZEALAND. The New Zealand Government will sell 25 pct of state-owned &lt;Air New Zealand Ltd> to the public, Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said. Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the timing of any sales and the price. ""Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best opportunity,"" Prebble said. ""We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New Zealand,"" he said. ""Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that means waiting for a while, then so be it,"" Prebble said. He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it would post an excellent profit. Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability to prosper in future was hampered by its wholly-government-owned status. Prebble said access to new sources of capital would increase its ability to expand and develop. This sale announcement follows the public float in March of around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>. The government has said it will also float part of the capital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC New Zealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd."	acq
FRENCH STATE SELL-OFFS RAISE 52 BILLION FRANCS. The French government's privatisation program, which began late last year, has earned the French State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry said. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion at the end of 1986. The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday. The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added. The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991. Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the near future are television network TF-1 later this month and banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn. The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a third of the government's programme would have been completed in less than nine months. Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched too low. He said that the average premium of shares trading on the Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar share flotations in Britain.	acq

He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from recession was under way in the oil and gas industries. ""Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"" Paues said. DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe, North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa. Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back exploration activities.

"ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS. Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts estimated. Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of the unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company's stock retreated, closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of days."" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its value was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500 to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been presented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion dlrs."	acq

"GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR. Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette Co that could draw some big international players and in the process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts said. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share."" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston Purina Co &lt;RAL>. ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he said.  Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. ""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition.

"SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS. Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,"" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields.  As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,"" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market.  Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""  Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years.  ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,"" said Fildes."	acq

Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned. Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011 in light of the recapitalization. Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount of the debenture.

Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr, they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares. Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not required to issue common to debenture holders who did not convert prior to June eight.

NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA. President Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets. David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.	acq

SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp. In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's takeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.	acq

"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING. Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a leading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area. ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's a hell of a place to do business with government."" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and charitable activities."	acq

"GENCORP &lt;GY> TO SELL GENERAL TIRE. Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash. Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30, 1984. The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions. Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations. Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs. GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement. Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt. In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses.  Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company, including general tire. ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.

A.H. ROBINS &lt;QRAH> TO CONSIDER RORER OFFER. A.H. Robins Co said its board has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group Inc &lt;ROR> merits further consideration. At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H. Robins. After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger. But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon Shield related liabilities. After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln dlrs. Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated 1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000 claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the Dalkon Shield interuterine device.	acq
"CITICORP &lt;CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH. Citicorp has extended its reach into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches, bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities, CitiCorp Savings said. Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows its serious intent to penetrate the California market. The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located. Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California. ""This marks our first major expansion in California, particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President Edward Valencia, in a statement. Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than Sears was in that market. ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego. Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to convert the branches to banks at that time. In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson and Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American First Savings Bank &lt;GTA>."	acq

Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan.

""The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company's allegations,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC.

""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"" Alpert said. ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,"" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said."	acq

BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE. Current prospects for this year's grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade said in a field report. The report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to April 4. It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring. However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said. Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said. Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.	grain
"U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER. Prospects appear slim for a summer meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement, Agriculture Department officials said. The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said. ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.  There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made. ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said. Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."" Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping logistics and production outlooks."	grain
"SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT. Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said. USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."" ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.  In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes."	grain

FUEL STORAGE TANKS IN FRANCE BURST INTO FLAMES. Two people were missing and six injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of fuel burst into flames today at a Shell storage unit in Lyon, rescue workers said. The blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local time (1130 GMT). Shell is a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>. Some 200 firemen fought the flames at the gasoline storage unit at Edouard Herriot riverside port complex and appeared to have the blaze under control as night fell. The entire southern section of Lyon was cordoned off. The fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four others, the Shell spokesman said. He said that the company estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of domestic fuel oil, gasoline and additives had been burned. The total capacity of the burning tanks was over 10,000 cubic metres, but some had been empty when an explosion started today's fire, he added.	fuel
TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET. The Tanzanian government, in its second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on government services. Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8, 39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide 48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to be financed through domestic and foreign loans. This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only 3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No figure for the final deficit was avaialble. The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30 pct. Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would rise by 75 pct. The higher levies affect official transactions such as road tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.	fuel

"U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER. U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a recovery in April. ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" said Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three weeks later than last year. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted 5.7 pct last year. ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear to be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" said analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham. Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise. In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the holiday nears. ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a continuing strength in the housing market,"" said Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's sportswear were also excellent. ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"" said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's overall sales rose 4.8 pct. Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continued strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed southwest."" ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins, but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a tougher comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."" Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower than last year. ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales are coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner. Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of the year. Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of May.
