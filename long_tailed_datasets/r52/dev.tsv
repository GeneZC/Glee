"COPPER MEETING AGREES GOALS OF STUDY GROUP. The world's major copper producing and consuming countries have reached ""a degree of consensus"" on objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at reviewing the world copper market, officials said. Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed forum for copper have recommended that another session be held in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said. The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group. The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to stabilise depressed world prices. Its objectives would include increasing market transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking activities aimed at developing the copper market and contributing to improvement of demand. UNCTAD's spokesman said, ""Once they have agreed on detailed functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to setting up the body."""	copper
"ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA. Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said. The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, ""My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines."" According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. ""The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,"" one western diplomat said. ""A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,"" he added."	copper

"NORANDA SAYS FIRE CAUSED 10 MLN DLRS IN DAMAGE. &lt;Noranda Inc> said a copper mine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for nearly a day caused an estimated 10 mln Canadian dlrs in damage. The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than 24 hours, destroyed the mine's three-year-old conveyor system, officials said. Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda will operate the mine at about one third of its normal 72,000 short ton annual finished capacity, using above ground reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open. ""The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations,"" Lefebvre said. Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates the Murdochville mine. He said it would take four or five months to bring operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so, adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will fully reopen the mine."	copper
NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS. Noranda Inc said production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here until it can completely examine the mine. If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or five months before it could resume full production. Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more specific. Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual finished capacity. The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out late yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure, Coffin said. One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground for about 24 hours before being brought safely out.	copper
CCC EXPORT BONUS DAIRY CATTLE FOR CANARY ISLANDS. The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has accepted a bonus offer from an exporter on the sale of 75 head of dairy cattle to the Canary Islands, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the bonus awarded was 1,459.00 dlrs per head and was made to T.K. International Inc. It will be paid in the form of commodities from the inventory of CCC stocks. The cattle are for delivery during March-June, 1987, it said. An additional 3,925 head of dairy cattle are still available to the Canary Islands under the Export Enahcnement Program initiative announced July 28, 1986, it said.	livestock

STORM BRINGS HEAVY SNOWS TO U.S. PLAINS. The National Weather Service said a powerful winter storm centered over north central Oklahoma was spreading snow from western and central Kansas across much of Nebraska to southern and eastern South Dakota. Rain was reported across parts of Minnesota, Iowa, eastern Kansas, Missouri and eastern Oklahoma, with showers and a few thundershowers extending from Arkansas through the lower Mississippi Valley to Alabama and northwest Florida. Strong winds of 20 to 35 mph with some stronger gusts were reported across much of the Plains, causing considerable blowingand drifting snow. A blizzard warning continued this morning across most of western Kansas. A winter storm warning was issued this morning over central and northeast Nebraska. Weather advisories were posted for this morning over central Kansas and central and southeast sections of South Dakota where two to five inches of snow could accumulate. Locally heavy rains accompanied the storm over portions of the central Plains. Flash flood watches were issued for this morning across the eastern half of Kansas. A flood warning continues today for eastern Nebraska. Widespread lowland and small stream flooding is expected to continue over most of eastern Nebraska through Wednesday. Due to cold, damp and windy conditions, livestock advisories were posted this morning across central and southeast portions of South Dakota. As the storm moves north across the central Plains, winter storm watches were issued over south central South Dakota, late tonight and Wednesday over west central Minnesota. Elsewhere, a travelers advisory remains in effect this morning over northeast New Mexico and the Oklahoma and Tecas Panhandle for blowing snow and slick roadways and across the mountains and deserts of southern California for strong gusty winds of 25 to 40 mph. Gale warnings were issued for today along the central California Coast. Mostly clear skies extended from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through the central Appalachians to the central Atlantic Coast and New England.	livestock
"BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE. The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP) said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of rights to float a new company, &lt;BHP Gold Mines Ltd> (BHPGM), which will hold most of BHP's gold interests. In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer. BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares, or 56 pct of issued capital, on the same terms. BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP's gold interests, excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea's &lt;Ok Tedi Mining Ltd> and those interests held by BHP's &lt;Utah International Inc>. The BHP statement said the issue will be made to shareholders registered on March 27. It opens April 4 and closes April 29, and is underwritten by &lt;J.B. Were and Son>. Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March 23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4. BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development. The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP's 45 pct stake in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland. BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality gold stock. ""The diversity and depth of BHP Gold's portfolio ... Give the company a sound foundation in current gold production and an exciting potential for growth,"" he said."	gold
CAROLIN MINES &lt;CRLNF> HAS NEW ASSAY RESULTS. Carolin Mines Ltd said recent assays of tailings at its Hope, British Columbia mine indicated that ounces of gold per ton ranged from 0.64 to 0.50. There were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium, the company said. Carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlier assay performed by Intergold U.S.A.

Carolin also said it expects to receive results of further tests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks.	gold
BELGIUM DETAILS PRICING PLAN FOR ECU GOLD COIN. The 50 European Currency Unit gold coins which go on sale tomorrow in Belgium will be priced at a premium of seven pct to the value of the gold they contain, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.

"GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD RISING IN 2ND HALF 1987. The price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand, West German analysts said. Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins. ""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs. Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs. Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said. Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver. Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year. The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said."	gold
PERU SAYS NEW GOLD DEPOSITS WORTH 1.3 BILLION DLRS.

Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year, he added. Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at Tamborapa, Pachapidiana and a zone between the Cenepa and Santiago rivers.	gold

"BANK OF ZAMBIA PAYS OUT FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS. The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a bank spokesman said. ""We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs,"" the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out. The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28. It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha's exchange rate. Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange. The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct."	money-fx
AUSTRALIAN RESERVE BANK IN BUYING INTERVENTION. The Reserve Bank said at 1230 local time it was offering to buy short-dated government securities in the short-term money market. The bank's action followed its purchase of short-dated government stock and six-day repurchase agreements earlier in the session. Money market traders said the move was aimed at easing cash market interest rates which had risen on demand for funds to meet PAYE tax and treasury note settlement commitments.	money-fx
BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS. Taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency. The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation. Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States. Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.	money-fx
ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES. Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected.	money-fx
"SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS. The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. ""The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. ""The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,"" the banker said. ""This is going to take a big bite out of profits."" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year."	money-fx

"SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION. Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was ""very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months."" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30."	money-fx

"ITALY RELAXES RESTRICTIONS ON LIRA IMPORTS. Italy is to modify restrictions limiting the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said.

It did not say when the new measure would come into force. In future, there will be no limit to the amount of lira bank notes both residents and non-residents can bring into Italy. The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made appropriate declarations at customs points. It said the lifting of the restrictions ""reinforces the international status of the lira and meets the requirements expressed several times by foreign exchange dealers."""	money-fx
ASIAN DOLLAR MARKET ASSETS FALL IN JANUARY. The gross size of the Asian dollar market contracted to 197.2 billion U.S. Dlrs in January, down 3.4 billion dlrs from December, reflecting a decline in interbank activity, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its latest monthly bulletin. The assets stood at 151.7 billion dlrs in January last year. MAS said interbank lending fell in January to 140.9 billion dlrs from 146.6 billion in December but rose from 102.0 billion in january 1986 and interbank deposits to 154.0 billion against 159.4 and 117.1 billion, respectively.

JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY - SUMITA. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.	money-fx
"CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED. The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. ""The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,"" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. ""I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,"" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. ""Coordinated, punishing intervention"" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. ""I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),"" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. ""The basic trend in the currencies is higher,"" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""The market wants to take the dollar lower."" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday's employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar."	money-fx
"LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a ""reasonable alignment of currencies"" and the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said. That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.

BELGIAN DECEMBER INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS. Industrial production, excluding construction and adjusted for the number of working days, fell 1.5 pct in December from year earlier levels, the National Statistics Office said. It was also a sharp 16.8 pct below the November level, it said. The office said the production index, base 1980, stood at 97.3 in December against an adjusted 116.9 in November and 98.8 in December 1985.	ipi
"BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY. inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed. ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln."	trade
"JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS. Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese government official said. ""But we are also frustrated."" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. ""It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said."	trade
"TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS. Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,"" he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

"ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support. He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget. However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection. ""To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"" he said. This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year."	trade
"TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES FOREIGN GOODS IMPORT CURBS. Taiwan said it would soon relax import controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and books, in a further effort to allow trading partners, especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.

He said the new move was intended to balance trade between Taiwan and its trading partners. The island's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985. In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes. ""We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus this year, especially with that of the U.S.,"" the spokesman said. Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 1.87 billion in the year-earlier period."	trade
BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY. The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show. The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below the same month last year. Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion. Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth. Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil. In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period. This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government's program for economic growth, Fendt added.	trade
JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said. The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year. MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback. One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up. MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.	trade
"SENATE WANTS JAPAN SEMICONDUCTER PACT ENFORCED.

While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action, Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue. ""We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan's unfair trade practices. A key House trade lawmaker, Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years."	trade

"PHILIPPINE TRADE SECRETARY PLEASED WITH GATT TALKS. Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences, said he was pleased with the latest gathering here. Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal. ""Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,"" he added in an interview with Reuters. ""In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,"" he said. Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a ""shining act of faith"" in the world trade system. Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive. He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples. He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries.

Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka.

"INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY. World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers. ""We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,"" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes. ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports. ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world,"" he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month."	trade

"UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN. William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming ""one of the world's industrial lightweights."" Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry. Bywater said, ""I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."""	trade

WHITE HOUSE PANEL SAID URGING JAPAN RETALIATION. The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers.	trade

"IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS. Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared."	trade
U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS. U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports. But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17. The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties would be retroactive to March 31. Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted. Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.

"CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. TRADE BILL. A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress. At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations. The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy. Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds. Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, ""I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."" ""I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill,"" he added. Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour."	trade
"PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. ""The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,"" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered."	cocoa
"ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW. The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow, delegates said. ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a ""pre-compromise"" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said. While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said. ""I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the session,"" a consumer delegate said. Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades, delegates said. Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin. Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said. The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said."	cocoa
DUTCH COCOA BEAN IMPORTS RISE IN JANUARY.

NIGERIA, GUINEA SET UP IRON ORE FIRM WITH LIBERIA. Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said. The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa. Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved, but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets. Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, which is also expected to give financial support. Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year, will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990. On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and silver.	iron-steel

"TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES. Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. ""We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future,"" Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. ""We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"" he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright."	ship

STRIKE TO CLOSE NEW ZEALAND PORTS ON MONDAY. Harbour workers said they will strike for 24 hours on Monday, effectively closing all New Zealand's ports. The strike is over deadlocked wage negotiations. A Harbour Employees Workers' Union spokesman told reporters there will be no ship movements in and out of ports from midnight on Sunday (1200 hrs GMT March 15). There will be no loading or unloading involving harbour board workers and the Cook Strait ferries, which provide a vital link between New Zealand's North and South Islands, will not run, he added.	ship
"DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS. Employers in Rotterdam's troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters. Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector. The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers' plans for 350 redundancies this year. A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7. Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case. ""We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business, and further delays would do even more damage,"" Zeebregts said. The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce by 1990, starting with 350 this year."	ship
ACCORD SAID IN SIGHT IN BRAZIL SEAMEN'S STRIKE. An accord is in sight in Brazil's 20-day-old national seamen's strike, which has seriously delayed exports, a union official said. The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. He said the others had returned to work over the last week, accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the state-owned oil company Petrobras. The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over payment for overtime. The union official said he believed this issue would be resolved shortly.	ship
PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE. Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year's revenues. This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides. He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future. Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.	ship
"IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING. Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region. Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world."" U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda."" He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway."" ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region."	ship
UNITED STATES LINES LAYS OFF FAR EAST STAFF. &lt;United States Lines Inc> has laid off 260 employees, almost its entire Far East staff, its Hong Kong office general manager Elliott Burnside told Reuters. He also said calls by two of its container ships to Busan, South Korea and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, had been cancelled. He declined comment on local press reports that U.S. Lines planned to suspend operations because of failure to restructure its 1.27 billion U.S. Dlr debt, but said the firm would make an announcement later today. U.S. Lines filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter Eleven of the U.S. Federal law last November. The English-language South China Morning Post said U.S. Lines decided yesterday to sell its two remaining transpacific service fleets and assets and those of its U.S.-South America operation. It quoted a letter by company's chief executive Charles Hiltzheimer that said the ships and assets will be bought by rival U.S. Shipping companies, subject to approval by their boards. U.S. Lines' Far East operations comprise offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Busan, Seoul, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe and Osaka, Burnside said.	ship

AUSTRALIAN UNIONS LAUNCH NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES. Australian trade unions said they have launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce injury compensation payments. Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise. Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's most populous state were the first to be affected, and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement. The state government recently introduced a new workers' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary ratification. NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers' compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year. Union officials said industrial action could spread to other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp cuts in workers' compensation.	ship
U.S. COTTON CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION DATE EXTENDED. Expiration dates on upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.

"ALCOA DECLINES SPECIFIC COMMENT ON OPTIONS TRADE. Alcoa officials acknowledged the possibility that they may have a position in the off-exchange aluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding position. An Alcoa (Aluminum Company of America) source involved in terminal trading for the company said: ""We use all means available to manage our business, so it's a possibility we're trading options."" ""We won't go into specifics about what we're doing. But when you're dealing in un-alloyed ingot, it's a commodity business where there are a lot of tools available (for hedging) and Alcoa is using all of those tools,"" said Al Posti, Alcoa's manager of corporate news. Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and May. However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they believe the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated. The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the second quarter, traders said. ""If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would mean really squeezing the market,"" one New York trader said, noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were 90,500 tonnes at the end of last week."	alum

"WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN. a confidential world bank report on the peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation. The report, published today by an economic monthly, the peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth ""represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."" Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties. ""an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added."	gnp
AUSTRIAN 1987 GROWTH SEEN BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 PCT. A meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said. This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last December. Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative. Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states. Hannes Androsch, general director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, today put 1987 GDP growth at between one and 1.5 pct.

CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED. Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said. Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.	sugar
LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA. The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87.	sugar
CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES. Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87) is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review. Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations. Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.	sugar
COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION. Costa Rica has agreed to sell more than 32,000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union, a spokesman for local producers said. Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Rica's quota for sugar exports to the U.S. Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic. A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship will take an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later. Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold.	sugar
"NEW CHIEF ELECTED FOR WORLD SUGAR ORGANISATION. Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over as executive director of the International Sugar Organization (ISO) in mid-April, ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff said. Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February last year. Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the ""house in order"" by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions. Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic clauses, he said. Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact."	sugar
JAPAN SLIGHTLY REDUCES SUGAR CONSUMPTION ESTIMATE. The Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623,300 tonnes on a refined basis, from 637,800 estimated at the end of December. It said the estimate for domestically produced sugar supply for the same period was revised to 190,400 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 195,100 tonnes, while imports were revised to 402,000 tonnes from the earlier 435,800 tonnes. It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 2.53 mln tonnes for the 1986/87 sugar year ending September 30. The ministry said the estimate for the 1986/87 year's supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881,000 tonnes, from the earlier estimate of 863,000. The estimate for 1986/87 imports was revised to 1.642 mln tonnes, from an earlier 1.645 mln tonnes.	sugar
WEST GERMAN 1986 SUGAR OUTPUT RISES. West German sugar production last year rose 38,000 tonnes to an estimated 3.17 mln tonnes, the Agricultural Ministry said. It said the increase was exclusively due to higher beet sugar content, which went up to 17.93 pct from 17.3 pct in 1985. Last year's beet deliveries totalled 20.22 mln tonnes, down 554,000 tonnes from the previous year. The ministry estimates West Germany's sugar self-sufficiency during the current agricultural year (July/June) unchanged at 137 pct.	sugar

U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES. A total 102,350 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.864 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said. Out of this, traders in France received 31,000 tonnes, in West Germany 21,000, in Belgium 19,050, in the U.K. 15,800, in Denmark 8,500, in the Netherlands 6,000 and in Spain 1,000 tonnes, it added. Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Sep to be around 46.80 Ecus per 100 kilos while French traders had put the rebate at around 46.40 Ecus. Traders here had also forecast today's total authorised sugar tonnage export awards up to 100,000 tonnes versus 59,000 last week when the restitution was 45.678 Ecus. Total export authorisations for the 1985/86 campaign (42 weeks) now stand at 2,076,620 tonnes.	sugar
BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR. French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.	sugar
"LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER. A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus ""corenes pora"" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. ""The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,"" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. ""If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,"" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. ""Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,"" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. ""If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,"" one official said. ""But this again could benefit prices,"" a buyer said."	rubber
"RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS. The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, ""I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned."" ""It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed."" He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic ""that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."" Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, ""There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement."""	rubber
"TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED. Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin ""ring-out"" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to June 8."	tin

"BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT. The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. ""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,"" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day."	interest
LLOYDS BANK MATCHES BASE RATE CUT TO 10.5 PCT. Lloyds Bank Plc said it is cutting its base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct, effective tomorrow.

"SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit. ""The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"" he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added."	interest

BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.5 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER. The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22. The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires. Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said. The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks. However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity. The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred. Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion. For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.	interest
"BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS. The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight rates. The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion pesetas. A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing money supply figures for February. The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth was 11.4 pct last year. The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds. ""The policy is proving counter-productive and rates will have to come down in the long-term,"" the bank spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries. He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad. ""At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other countries with much lower rates,"" he said."	interest

Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."""	crude
SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD. Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.	crude

"EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING. OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS. China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km. Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered. Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.	crude
"MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS. Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese refiner said. ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability."" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices."" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."""	crude
MONTEDISON, OTHER REFINERIES TO SHUT FOR WORK. Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said. Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd. Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude. Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said. Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said. The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said. In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said. Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day. Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks. As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April.	crude
"BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA. Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced."" Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,"" Santana added."	crude

The shipment is part contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June.	crude
HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS. Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat.	crude
"U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy. The study was outlined in a New York Times report today."	crude
U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88. The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86. The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year. The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year. A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury said.	crude
"OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL. OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said.

Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said.

The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money. ""My personal feeling is that is too low.

But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks. He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did not agree with existing policy, ""We'll take a look at it."" The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic Policy Council. Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security."	crude
"U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE. Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production. The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday. Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: ""that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."" He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy."	crude
CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE. Canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.	crude
"BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES. The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added."	crude

He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not impose any conditions on Brazil. Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil decided to reconfirm the purchase. Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day.	crude
"COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE BUT NO AGREEMENT YET. Coffee quota talks at the International Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas, delegates said. The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they said. Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time. ""Anything could happen,"" one delegate said."	coffee
"COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL. Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. ""In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"" Cardenas said."	coffee
"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS. Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,"" Dauster said, adding ""now it is time to go and sell coffee."" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a ""simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. ""We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. ""Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said."	coffee
"IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED. Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. ""I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,"" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he said without elaborating. ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,"" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed ""his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future"" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate."	coffee
"IBC PRESIDENT NOT TO ATTEND ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD. Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) president Jorio Dauster said he will not attend the ICO executive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a report of his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the New York coffee market today. ""I have too much work to accomplish here in Brazil at the moment. Besides the presence of the IBC president at an ICO executive board meeting is not a tradition,"" Dauster said. Dauster said except in rare cases, Brazil has always sent its London-based representative to ICO board meetings. Ambassador Lindenberg Sette will attend the meeting, he said."	coffee
"SEASONAL STABILISATION SEEN FOR COFFEE PRICES. The onset of cooler weather in Brazil during the southern hemisphere winter is expected to have a stabilising effect on a weak coffee market, West German trade sources said. ""The annual fear of frost in Brazil will probably grip the market sometime this month until June or early July,"" one trader said. The trade believes the International Coffee Organization (ICO) is unlikely to tackle the re-introduction of quotas before its September meeting and until then the market will not see any unexpected sharp moves in either direction."	coffee

"U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY SAYS EXPORT RISE NEEDED. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said after the release of a sharply lower January leading indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed. ""The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net exports,"" he said in a statement after the department reported the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984. The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods."	lei
U.S. LEADING INDEX ROSE 0.7 PCT IN FEBRUARY. The U.S. index of leading indicators rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised 0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said. The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in January. The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices. A total of four of nine indicators available for February contributed to the increase in the index. Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, average work week and building permits. Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance, average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance, and contracts and orders for plant and equipment. The main factor in the January revision was contracts and orders for plant and equipment, the department said. December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier 2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit. The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of 1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December. The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February after increasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct in December. The department said it has suspended net business formation from the leading indicators index because it has deteriorated as a measure of change in the business population.	lei
"TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. ""For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,"" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. ""In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,"" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. ""No replanting programme has been successful,"" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to ""farm"" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers."	lumber
"USDA CORRECTS TURKEY CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT. The U.S. Agriculture Department said an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S. commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies. First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber. The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood. Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that ""it's possible it would be."" Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product. Members states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer concessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said. However, the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program, Sims said. Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers. In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is available only for public sector importers, Walter Stern, Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said."	lumber

"MITCHELL ENERGY &lt;MND> AGAIN CUTS CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Mitchell Energy and Development Corp said it plans to hold its capital spending in fiscal 1988, ending January 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the 123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986. The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due to mild weather and soft economic conditions. ""But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up during the course of the year,"" Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market. Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend to lower the average price realized for gas in the early part of fiscal 1988. However, it said the average for the full year is not expected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per thousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987."	nat-gas

Enough European Community (EC) states appear to be opposed to the proposals by the EC Commission for a 330 European currency unit (Ecu) a tonne tax on vegetable oils, fats and marine oils to block adoption by EC ministers, British Farm Minister Michael Jopling said. He told a news conference held during a meeting here of EC agriculture ministers that Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Portugal were all against the tax.

"BALLADUR MAINTAINS 1987 FRENCH INFLATION TARGET. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in retail prices for February. He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct. He said he was happy with ""a good result"" for February but stressed a need for continued ""vigilance"" against inflation. A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year differential between French and lower West German inflation rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January. If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential came to 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding ""The tendency is therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main trading partner."""	cpi
OECD JANUARY ANNUAL INFLATION STEADY AT 2.1 PCT. Inflation in the 24 industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was 2.1 pct in the year to January, unchanged from December, the OECD said. But monthly inflation throughout the OECD was an average 0.4 pct in January, a rise compared to the 0.2 pct in the last quarter. Retail energy prices rose strongly in January, reflecting the firming of world oil prices. For OECD states the increase was 0.7 pct but the January level of retail energy prices was still 11.6 pct lower than a year earlier, the OECD said. The increase in consumer prices excluding food and energy, at 0.4 pct in January for the whole OECD area, was unchanged on the four previous months, but over the year to January OECD consumer prices rose by 3.5 pct, against 3.3 pct in December. Unadjusted annual inflation for the seven leading industrialised nations in January was running at 4.4 pct in Italy, 3.9 pct in Britain and Canada, three pct in France, 1.4 pct in the U.S., Minus 0.8 pct in West Germany and minus 1.5 pct in Japan, the OECD said.	cpi
SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE. Sweden's rate of inflation during January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without explaining how the error arose. Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1 pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for January's revised figures, it added. Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct in February 1986, the bureau said. The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the bureau added.	cpi
"FED'S JOHNSON SEES INFLATION CONTROLLED. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said inflationary pressures are under control and noted ""wage and price pressures are very moderate."" Johnson told a women's group that the U.S. was not seeing the kind of cost pressures of the past. He said the trade imbalance was a serious trouble spot and strong protectionist pressures, if translated into policies, could ultimately lead to higher inflation and a high interest rate policy by the Fed."	cpi
U.K. RETAIL PRICES RISE 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY. The Retail Price Index (RPI), Britain's measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment Department said. In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index. The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct year-on-year increase on the old basis. The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about four pct, economists said. The Employment Department said the rise in the index between January and February was mainly the result of higher prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.	cpi

ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED. The combined profits of Japan's major corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said. It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.	earn

"WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC>. Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company. Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier. Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>. ""The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX,"" Harlow said. ""Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half."" Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. ""The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs,"" Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share.

Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30. Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada. The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues. Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for &lt;Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear. Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books. The company is also marketing an extended line of ""laser tag"" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone. Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs."	earn

JAPAN BUSINESS DECLINE SEEN BOTTOMING OUT. The extended decline in Japan's overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said. Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it said after carrying out a quarterly survey. The survey, conducted in February, was based on questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries. The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 5.4 pct decrease in the first half. Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added. Manufacturers' earnings, hit hard by the yen's steady rise against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it said. Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey said. It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen's appreciation.	earn

ZIM said Chemclear Inc &lt;CMCL> has unilaterally canceled an agreement to merge with ZIM, and ZIM's board is studying the possiblity of a claim against Chemclear. The company said it expects to report a loss for the year of about 3,125,000 dlrs due to lower oil and natural gas prices, unsuccessful well workover programs and excessive overhead and corporate expenses. It said it plans a dramatic reduction in overhead costs that should improve results. The company said Michel Billard has been named chairman and Robert Berckmans has been named president and chief executive, and Berckmans and two others have joined the board. ZIM said it has agreed to acquire the remaining interest in its Buccaneer and Blue Dolphin Pipeline affiliates for about one mln dlrs in cash and stock.  It gave no further details.	earn
"H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM. With the April 15 tax return deadline less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes. Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a ""bonanza,"" analysts say. ""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice President Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congress drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers benefit,"" Bloch said. ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said. ""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added. Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987 earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs. ""Next year, Block could have a bonanza,"" Buchbinder said. Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns, up 1.5 pct over the previous year. The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according to the IRS. For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide, there are some changes in the act that will have a negative effect, Bloch conceded. Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the tax rolls, he said. Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73 dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he said. Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of its electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted. The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in the 1986 tax season. First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988. Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for television ads. ""They may get a little more bang for their buck,"" he said. He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could be of great benefit to them."	earn

"LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION &lt;LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR. Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase by ""substantially more"" than the 30 pct average annual growth experienced in the last four years. Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts. Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs, or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs. De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results"" in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more specific. He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990. De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The rest came from acquisitions, he said. Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation, a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said. He also said he is ""not very optimistic"" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary. De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp. ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management,"" de Groote said. Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S. subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing. De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants. De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct. The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it, he said. He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely within the next few months."	earn

"SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT. Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its ""A"" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. ""Much depends on properties,"" said Measor. ""And they did a lot better in the second half of the year."" Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said. ""At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,"" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd. Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions."	earn

Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6 billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise, however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985. Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV &lt;AKZO.AS>. BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion. U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina. BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar, Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for producing tetrahydrofuran.	earn
BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS. A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc's &lt;BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement. The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions. Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper. Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume. The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT. BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms. Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth. Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K. Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half. Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development. Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg. BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.	earn

SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals Ltd from the Canadian government. The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, Taylor said. Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, Taylor said. Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain. In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.	earn

VARITY&lt;VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR. Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully integrated. However, operating results are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said. Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier profit of 3.9 mln dlrs. Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss. Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's depressed levels, the company said. However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said. The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.	earn

GALACTIC &lt;GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING. Galactic Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs. As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984. Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said. Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results. The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said. Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments. Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings. The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces. Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000 ounces.	earn

Honeywell Bull Inc, owned by Honeywell Inc &lt;HON>, &lt;Cie des Machines Bull> and &lt;NEC Corp>, said it expects its 1987 revenues to increase 15 to 20 pct over its current level of about 1.9 billion dlrs. Honeywell Bull president Jerome Meyer also told the press conference the company was profitable, adding the company aimed to improve profits over time. Honeywell Inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cash for the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to Bull and NEC. Honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in Honeywell Bull and Bull will own an equal amount. NEC owns 15 pct of the company. Meyer, who had been executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, said Honeywell Bull would work closely with NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketing computers to multi-national companies. ""We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are going to turn that around,"" Meyer said. He said business was soft in the U.S. He said the company was reorganizing its distribution programs and its staff, reassigning and laying off selected employees. He also said the company was hiring new workers. Honeywell Bull chairman Jacques Stern, who is also chairman of Bull, said he believed the computer industry could be a fast growing market for companies that provide the type of computers customers want.

"CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS. Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action ""would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,"" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. ""They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,"" said Pulcine, ""and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not."" Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp &lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. ""In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,"" said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, ""wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position."" Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. ""I think that is just for the benefit of the public,"" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. ""From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,"" said Meredith. ""My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings."" Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. ""If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,"" Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that ""it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year."" He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings."	earn

Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln and earnings per share 2.46 dlrs. It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader Automotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year. Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will not conform to historical patterns for the year because the acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different quarters.

If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its term debt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments for the rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would be reduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs. U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to be placed on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90 days or more.  However, Manufacturers Hanover said that, in light of current circumstances, it was more appropriate to record income on its Brazilian loans only when cash payments were received. It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement with its banks on a debt restructuring and that all interest payments will be received later in 1987. The company earned 102.1 mln dlrs in first-quarter 1986 and 410.7 mln dlrs for the whole of the year.	earn

GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS. West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year.	earn

CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST SEES BETTER MARKET. (Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report. Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings. Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs. The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism. It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions. It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions. Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases.	earn

REPUBLICBANK &lt;RPT> TO RECLASSIFY BRAZIL LOANS. RepublicBank Corp said it has placed 182.6 mln dlrs of all intermediate and term loans to Brazil on a non-accrual basis as of March 31. It said the reclassification will reduce first quarter earnings by 2.8 mln dlrs after taxes, and 11 mln dlrs after taxes for all of 1987, if Brazil does not change its position of a moratorium on interest payments. RepublicBank also said its net income for the first quarter is expected to be about 10.4 mln dlrs or 30 cts a share on a fully diluted basis. In the year-ago first quarter the company earned 23.1 mln dlrs or 75 cts a share. The company also said its first quarter results are expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs, about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln dlrs. It said the provision will increase loan losses to about 328 mln dlrs or 2.2 pct of loans.

BOTSWANA BANS ZIMBABWE MEAT PRODUCTS, AGENCY SAYS. Botswana has stopped importing almost all meat products from Zimbabwe after reports of a suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the neighbouring country. Botswana's official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be allowed into the country, with immediate effect. He said Zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at Insiza, 100 km northeast of Bulawayo, capital of the mainly cattle-ranching southwestern province of Matabeleland. Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for comment. The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk, ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported. Botswana exports much of its high-grade beef to the European Community and augments its local supplies with meat imports from Zimbabwe.	carcass
"CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS.

Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon. ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs, maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer, announced before the opening today, expires March 25. ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready. She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials. ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang, analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would."" Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice."	acq

"HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION. The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels."" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs."	acq

Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its financial advisor, Pantera's said. Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ, while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger.

"HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> SAYS BAKER &lt;BKO> MERGER ALIVE. Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the best interests of both companies. ""Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies,"" Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. ""We're working very hard on this merger."" Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. ""We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal."" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker ""was not a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too ""unreasonable."" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies."	acq

Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of common stock.

"SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG>. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement action against Allegheny International Inc, the Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said. Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc. ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said. ""The company is cooperating in the commission's investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said. In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked for information about company executive compensation and benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft. It also has asked for information on acquisitions and divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other internal controls,"" Allegheny said. The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said. The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions. The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements. The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors. Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price. Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges. The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley. In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March 13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share."	acq
U.S. HOUSE PLAN SEEKS TO BAR FOREIGN TAKEOVERS. A House subcommittee voted to give President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies similar to the takeover of Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB> Fairchild Semiconductor Corp by Fujitsu Ltd which was withdrawn. The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if the sale was not in the national or economic interest. The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall trade bill which is being written by several House committees. The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips. This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products. The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S. engineering and construction firms are given adequate opportunity to bid on Japan's civil works procurement practices including the construction of the Kansai airport. The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered by Rep. William Dannemeyer, a California Republican, to require the U.S. to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold investments in government storage. His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins and gold-backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal debt.	acq

Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split. The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding. Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect. For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y. holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.

For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share.

CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock. It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation. It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said. CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses. These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.

"FERRUZZI MAY FLOAT UP TO 49 PCT OF PARIS UNIT. &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is studying a project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49 pct of its French unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> and could raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said. Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at ""international markets"" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports ""was probably about right."" European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy. Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs. A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details. The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business. In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was ""apparently still organising finance,"" his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630 mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid ""at the date foreseen in the preliminary contract."" Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by September 30. Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's European business was apparently rejected in favour of Ferruzzi's lower bid. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said ""Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC's European business."" Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under study, he added. Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC business, Gardini said: ""We do not exclude having minority partners in the CPC business.""

"COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES. &lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;United Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said. Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. ""It looks good,"" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. ""The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" Diaz said. ""Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""B"" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating ""fiduciary duty."" De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan."	acq

CHARTER CO &lt;QCHR> TO COMPLETE REORGANIZATION. Charter Co, the huge petrochemical concern in bankruptcy proceedings stemming from hundreds of dioxin-related claims, said it and all of its subsidiaries, except the Independent Petrochemical Corp, will complete their reorganization on March 31. It said that on that date, it will deposit with an escrow agent 288.8 mln dlrs in cash, 66.7 mln dlrs in notes and 31 mln shares of its common for distribution. Company officials were not immediately available for comment. As previously reported, Charter settled dioxin-related claims for about 1,200 individuals and the state of Missouri, resolving claims against it and all subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical. Charter said some of the settlements remain subject to appeals and final court approvals and resolve claims against charter and its subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical. It said about 500 individual claims against it and certain of its units remain pending as disputed claims in bankruptcy court. It said about 300 of these claims have been filed since confirmation of the joint plan of reorganization. Charter said its two creditors, an equity committee in its bankruptcy proceedings and &lt;American Financial Corp>, which will own 50.5 pct of its common after the reorganization, have waived the requirement that Charter resolve all dioxin-related claims against it prior to completing its reorganization. That requirement excludes claims against Independent Petrochemical. Charter also said a plan for liquidation of Independent has been approved by the bankruptcy court and will be completed after March 31. Earlier, Charter reported net income for the year of 153.2 mln dlrs, which included a gain of 28.5 mln dlrs for discontinued operations and 114.8 mln dlrs for the settlement of claims in its reorganization proceedings. In 1985, it reported earnings of 1,274,000 dlrs, which included a loss of 36.3 mln dlrs for discontinued operations and 29.4 mln dlrs for extraordinary items. For the fourth quarter, it reported earnings of 118.8 mln dlrs, including a gain of 28.6 mln dlrs for discontinued operations and 90.5 mln dlrs mainly for claims settlements. In the year-ago period, Charter reported a loss of 13 mln dlrs.	pet-chem
"U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION. The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement. Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop. An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel's move was ""an unfortunate first action"" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill."	grain

"EEP SHOULD BE USED TACTICALLY, YEUTTER SAYS. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, should be used as a ""tactical tool"" and not as a general policy. Yeutter made the comment in response to a question whether the U.S. should expand the EEP to cover grain sales to the Soviet Union. He did not comment directly on the Soviet question, replying that any decision would be made at the highest levels of the Reagan administration, and ""I don't want to preempt that."" Yeutter told the National Grain and Feed Association EEP should continue to be used as a tactical tool against the European Community but not as a general policy. He said selective EEP use has been successful in pressuring the E.C."	grain
U.S. SENATOR UNCOMMITTED ON OFFERING 0/92 BILL. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, has not decided whether to introduce an administration-backed bill to apply the so-called 0/92 provision to 1988 through 1990 grain crops, an aide to the senator said. The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the measure, the aide said. However, a number of farm groups have told Lugar they oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985 farm bill, and the senator has decided to take a second look at the proposal, the aide said. Last week the aide indicated Lugar was planning to offer the 0/92 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation loophole.	grain
"CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987. China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. ""China is short of foreign exchange,"" the Shanghai official said. ""We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer."" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. ""At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,"" the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. ""All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,"" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. ""In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,"" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. ""The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said."	grain
TRADE PROPOSES NEW EC GRAIN INTERVENTION RULES. The European Community (EC) cereals trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget money. It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium. Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution.	grain
"ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET. The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. ""The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops."" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make folks gun-shy,"" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business."" ""We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said. ""But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms."" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. ""In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but added, ""The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around."" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. ""I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization."" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. ""You're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" Mulligan said. ""Lower volume translates into higher costs."" According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out."	grain

U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY. U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billion dlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in January sales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The department previously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct. Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January. Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revision downward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealer sales figure than originally estimated. Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a 14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by 27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than the 22.4 pct fall originally reported. The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in January sales, department spokesmen said. Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72 billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January. Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling by 1.7 pct in January. Non-durable goods sales rose by 1.3 pct to 75.58 billion dlrs in February after falling by 0.2 pct in January, the department said. General merchandise stores rose 1.4 pct after increasing sales by 1.6 pct in January, and department stores were up two pct in February after rising 1.5 pct in January. Food store sales increased 0.4 pct after declining by 1.0 pct in January, while grocery store sales increased 0.3 pct in February after falling 0.6 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose 2.0 pct in February after a 1.9 pct January increase. Apparel store sales were up 0.8 pct last month after falling 3.0 pct in January, while sales at eating and drinking places increased 1.5 pct after rising 0.5 pct in January. February's retail sales were 4.4 pct above the year-ago level of 117.09 billion dlrs, the department said.	retail
